# Forward-Looking Statements

Actual events or results may differ from those expressed in forward-looking statements. As such, you should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, operating results, prospects, strategy, and financial needs.

The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The results, events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements may not be achieved or occur, and actual results, events or circumstances could differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant subject. These statements are based on information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. While we believe that such information provides a reasonable basis for these statements, such information may be limited or incomplete. Our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive inquiry into, or review of, all relevant information. These statements are inherently uncertain, and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely on these statements.

The forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q speak only as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information, actual results, revised expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements.

# Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)

# Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

# Description of Business

Uber Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware in July 2010, and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. Uber is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B.

Uber develops and operates proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on its platform (“platform(s)” or “Platform(s)”). Uber connects consumers (“Rider(s)”) with independent providers of ride services (“Mobility Driver(s)”) for ridesharing services, and connects Riders and other consumers (“Eaters”) with restaurants, grocers and other stores (collectively, “Merchants”) with delivery service providers (“Couriers”) for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Riders and Eaters are collectively referred to as “end-user(s)” or “consumer(s).” Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. Uber uses this same network, technology, operational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers (“Shipper(s)”) with carriers (“Carrier(s)”) in the freight industry. Uber is also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.

Our technology is used around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe (excluding Russia), the Middle East, Africa, and Asia (excluding China and Southeast Asia).

# Basis of Presentation

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regarding interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 included herein was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. As such, the information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year.

In the opinion of management, these financial statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair statement of the financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and the change in equity for the periods presented.

There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on February 15, 2024 that have had a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.

# Basis of Consolidation

Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Uber Technologies, Inc. and entities consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Refer to Note 12 – Variable Interest Entities for further information.

# Use of Estimates

The preparation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are based on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumptions which management believes are reasonable under the circumstances. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates estimates, including, but not limited to: fair values of investments and other financial instruments (including the measurement of credit or impairment losses); useful lives of amortizable long-lived assets; fair value of acquired intangible assets and related impairment assessments; impairment of goodwill; stock-based compensation; income taxes and non-income tax reserves; certain deferred tax assets and tax liabilities; insurance reserves; and other contingent liabilities. These estimates are inherently subject to judgment and actual results could differ from those estimates.

# Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-03, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair Value Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual Sale Restrictions,” which clarifies that contractual sale restrictions are not considered in measuring fair value of equity securities and requires additional disclosures for equity securities subject to contractual sale restrictions. The standard is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2024. The additional required disclosures did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.


# Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In November 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures,” which will add required disclosures of significant expenses for each reportable segment, as well as certain other disclosures to help investors understand how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) evaluates segment expenses and operating results. The new standard will also allow disclosure of multiple measures of segment profitability, if those measures are used to allocate resources and assess performance. The amendments will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures,” which requires disaggregated information about a reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. The standard is intended to benefit investors by providing more detailed income tax disclosures that would be useful in making capital allocation decisions. The standard will be effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this accounting standard update on our consolidated financial statement disclosures.

# Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis

The following table presents our financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis based on the three-tier fair value hierarchy (in millions):

# Fair Value Hierarchy

We measure our cash equivalents and certain investments at fair value. Level 1 instrument valuations are based on quoted market prices of the identical underlying security. Level 2 instrument valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for comparable instruments, identical instruments in less active markets, or models using market observable inputs. Level 3 instrument valuations are based on unobservable inputs and other estimation techniques due to the absence of quoted market prices, inherent lack of liquidity and the long-term nature of such financial instruments.

As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, our Level 3 non-marketable equity securities and note receivable from a related party primarily consist of common stock investments and convertible secured notes that may be converted into common or preferred stock in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values.

Depending on the investee’s financing activity in a reporting period, management’s estimate of fair value may be primarily derived from the investee’s financing transactions, such as the issuance of preferred stock to new investors. The price in these transactions generally provides the best indication of the enterprise value of the investee. Additionally, based on the timing, volume, and other characteristics of the transaction, we may supplement this information by using other valuation techniques, including the guideline public company approach. The guideline public company approach relies on publicly available market data of comparable companies and uses comparative valuation multiples of the investee’s revenue (actual and forecasted), and therefore, unobservable input used in this valuation technique primarily consists of short-term revenue projections.

Once the fair value of the investee is estimated, an option-pricing model (“OPM”), a common stock equivalent (“CSE”) method or a hybrid approach is employed to allocate value to various classes of securities of the investee, including the class owned by us. The model involves making assumptions around the investee’s expected time to liquidity and volatility.

An increase or decrease in any of the unobservable inputs in isolation, such as the security price in a significant financing transaction of the investee, could result in a material increase or decrease in our estimate of fair value. Other unobservable inputs, including short-term revenue projections, time to liquidity, and volatility are less sensitive to the valuation in the respective reporting periods, as a result of the primary weighting on the investee’s financing transactions. In the future, depending on the weight of evidence and valuation approaches used, these or other inputs may have a more significant impact on our estimate of fair value.

We determine realized gains or losses on the sale of equity and debt securities on a specific identification method.

# Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value Using Level 3 Inputs

The following table presents a reconciliation of our financial assets measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2024, using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) (in millions):

|Category|Non-marketable Equity Securities| |Note Receivable| |

# Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis

Non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property and equipment are adjusted to fair value when an impairment charge is recognized. Such fair value measurements are based predominantly on Level 3 inputs.

# Non-Marketable Equity Securities

Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. The carrying value of our non-marketable equity securities is adjusted based on price changes from observable transactions of identical or similar securities of the same issuer or for impairment. Any changes in carrying value are recorded within other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

# Didi Investment

As of December 31, 2023, and March 31, 2024, we measured the fair value of our Didi investment based on the closing share price of the Didi American Depositary Shares on the over-the-counter market as an observable transaction for similar securities. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2024, we recognized an unrealized gain of $357 million and an unrealized loss of $69 million, respectively, in other income (expense), net in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.

We did not record any other material unrealized or realized gains or losses for our non-marketable equity securities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the three months ended March 31, 2023, and 2024.

# 2030 Refinanced Term Loans

In March 2023, we entered into two refinancing transactions pursuant to an amendment to the 2016 Senior Secured Term Loan Agreement. On March 3, 2023, we entered into a refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $1.75 billion (“First Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2025 Refinanced Term Loan of $1.4 billion and $317 million of the outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. On March 14, 2023, we entered into the second refinancing transaction under which we borrowed $761 million (“Second Closing”), the proceeds of which were used to repay in full the outstanding 2027 Refinanced Term Loan. The Second Closing constituted an additional term loan in the same tranche as the First Closing (collectively, the “2030 Refinanced Term Loans”). In November 2023, we used a portion of the net proceeds from our 2028 Convertible Notes offering to pay down $500 million of our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. The partial extinguishment did not result in any changes to the terms of our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans.

The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans have a maturity date of March 3, 2030. The interest rate for the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans is Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) subject to a floor of 0.00%, plus 2.75% per annum. The refinancing transactions qualified as both a debt modification and debt extinguishment. As a result, we recognized an immaterial loss on debt extinguishment during the three months ended March 31, 2023 in other income (expense), net, in our condensed consolidated statement of operations. The refinancing transactions resulted in: (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. The cash inflow and cash outflow are recorded within cash flows from financing activities in our condensed statement of cash flows during three months ended March 31, 2023.

The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans agreements contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens and undergo certain fundamental changes. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2024. The loan is secured by certain of our intellectual property and equity of certain material foreign subsidiaries.

The fair value of our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans was $2.0 billion as of March 31, 2024 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

# 2025 Convertible Notes

In December 2020, we issued $1.15 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% convertible senior notes due in 2025 (the “2025 Convertible Notes”), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2025 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase up to an additional $150 million principal amount of the 2025 Convertible Notes. The 2025 Convertible Notes were issued in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The 2025 Convertible Notes will mature on December 15, 2025, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

Holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 15, 2025 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2021 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days.

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# 2025 Convertible Notes

As of March 31, 2024, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2025 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2025 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 12.3701 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $80.84 per share of common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid special interest.

Upon conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes, we will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.

# Amendments to 2025 Convertible Notes

On November 24, 2023, we entered into the First Supplemental Indenture, to an indenture, dated as of December 11, 2020, governing our outstanding 2025 Convertible Notes. Pursuant to the First Supplemental Indenture, we irrevocably elected to eliminate our option to choose Physical Settlement on any conversion of the 2025 Convertible Notes that occurs on or after the date of the First Supplemental Indenture.

# 2028 Convertible Notes

In November 2023, we issued $1.73 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.875% convertible senior notes due in 2028, including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of the 2028 Convertible Notes of their option to purchase up to an additional $225 million principal amount of the 2028 Convertible Notes. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2024, and the notes will mature on December 1, 2028, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased.

Holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes may convert their notes at their option at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding September 1, 2028 only under specified circumstances.

# Convertible Notes

As of March 31, 2024, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2028 Convertible Notes to convert their notes early had been met. Therefore, the 2028 Convertible Notes are classified as long-term.

The initial conversion rate is 13.7848 shares of the common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $72.54 per share of the common stock. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest.

Upon conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we must pay cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be converted and pay or deliver as the case may be, cash, shares of our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election in respect of the remainder, if any, of our conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being converted.

We may not redeem the notes prior to December 5, 2026. We may redeem for cash all or any portion of the notes, at our option, on or after December 5, 2026, if the last reported sale price of our common stock has been at least 130% of the conversion price then in effect for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any 30 consecutive trading day period (including the last trading day of such period) ending on, and including, the trading day immediately preceding the date on which we provide notice of redemption at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date.

The indenture governing the 2028 Convertible Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries.

The fair value of our 2028 Convertible Notes was $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2024 and was determined based on quoted prices in markets that are not active, which is considered a Level 2 valuation input.

# Capped Calls

In connection with the issuance of the 2028 Convertible Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions (“the Capped Calls”) with certain of the initial purchasers of the 2028 Convertible Notes or their respective affiliates (the “option counterparties”) at a cost of approximately $141 million. The Capped Calls cover, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock initially underlying the 2028 Convertible Notes. By entering into the Capped Calls, we expect to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock (or, in the event a conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes is settled in cash, to reduce our cash payment obligation) in the event that at the time of conversion of the 2028 Convertible Notes the trading price of our common stock price exceeds the conversion price of the 2028 Convertible Notes.

The initial cap price of the Capped Calls was approximately $95.81 per share, which represents a premium of 75% over the last reported sale price of our common stock of $54.75 on the New York Stock Exchange on November 20, 2023, and is subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Calls. The Capped Calls were included in additional paid-in capital in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, with no remeasurement in subsequent periods as it meets the conditions for equity classification.

# Senior Notes

The 2026, 2027, 2028 and 2029 Senior Notes (collectively “Senior Notes”) are guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries. The indentures governing the Senior Notes contain customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt and incur liens, as well as certain financial covenants specified in the indentures. We were in compliance with all covenants as of March 31, 2024.

# Interest Expense Related to Long-Term Debt

The following table presents the amount of interest expense recognized relating to the contractual interest coupon and amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs with respect to our long-term debt, for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024 (in millions):

|Three Months Ended March 31|2023|2024|
|---|---|---|
|Contractual interest coupon|$147|$123|
|Amortization of debt discount and issuance costs|$7|$4|
|Total interest expense from long-term debt|$154|$127|

# Revolving Credit Arrangements

We have a revolving credit agreement initially entered into during 2015 with certain lenders, which provides for $2.3 billion in credit maturing on June 13, 2023 (“Revolving Credit Facility”). On April 4, 2022, we entered into an amendment to our Revolving Credit Facility to, among other things:

- Provide for approximately $2.2 billion of revolving credit commitments.
- Extend the maturity date for the commitments and loans from June 13, 2023 to April 4, 2027.
- Reduce the minimum liquidity covenant from $1.5 billion to $1.0 billion.
- Replace the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) based interest rate with a SOFR based interest rate.
- Make certain other changes to the negative covenants under the amended revolving credit agreement.

The Revolving Credit Facility may be guaranteed by certain of our material domestic restricted subsidiaries based on certain conditions. The credit agreement contains customary covenants restricting our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to incur debt, incur liens, and undergo certain fundamental changes, as well as maintain a certain level of liquidity specified in the contractual agreement. We were in compliance with all covenants in the Revolving Credit Facility as of March 31, 2024. The credit agreement also contains customary events of default and restrictions on the payment of dividends.

On July 28, 2023, we entered into a joinder agreement to our Revolving Credit Facility to add an incremental revolving loan lender and increase the available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by an aggregate principal amount of $250 million. The joinder agreement brings the total revolver capacity to approximately $2.5 billion. There were no changes to the pricing or maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility.

As of March 31, 2024, there was no balance outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility.

# Freight Holding

In February 2023, Uber Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”) entered into a $300 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility guaranteed by the assets of Freight Holding. As of March 31, 2024, there was no balance outstanding on Freight Holding’s revolving credit facility.

# Letters of Credit

For purposes of securing obligations related to leases and other contractual obligations, we also maintain an agreement for letters of credit, which is collateralized by our Revolving Credit Facility and reduces the amount of credit available. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, we had letters of credit outstanding of $975 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of which the letters of credit that reduced the available credit under the Revolving Credit Facility were $287 million and $378 million, respectively.

# Quarterly Report - Stockholders' Equity

# Equity Compensation Plans

We maintain four equity compensation plans that provide for the issuance of shares of our common stock to our officers and other employees, directors, and consultants: the 2010 Stock Plan (the “2010 Plan”), the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and the 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”), which have all been approved by stockholders. Following our initial public offering (“IPO”) in May 2019, we have only issued awards under the 2019 Plan and the ESPP, and no additional awards will be granted under the 2010 and 2013 Plans. These plans provide for the issuance of incentive stock options (“ISOs”), nonqualified stock options (“NSOs”), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based awards, and other awards (that are based in whole or in part by reference to our common stock).

# Stock Option and SAR Activity

# Stock-Based Compensation Expense

|---|---|---|
|Operations and support|$38|$67|
|Sales and marketing|$24|$21|
|Research and development|$290|$299|
|General and administrative|$118|$97|
|Total|$470|$484|

As of March 31, 2024, there was $4.2 billion of unamortized compensation costs related to all unvested awards. The unamortized compensation costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.96 years.
      The tax benefits recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation arrangements were not material during the
three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively.
      Share Repurchase Authorization
      In February 2024, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion in shares of our outstanding common stock. The timing, manner, price
and amount of any repurchases are determined by the discretion of management, depending on market conditions and other factors. Repurchases may be made
through open market purchases and accelerated share repurchases. The exact number of shares to be repurchased by us, if any, is not guaranteed. Depending on
market conditions and other factors, these repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or periodically without prior notice.
Note 8 – Income Taxes
      We compute our quarterly income tax expense/(benefit) by using a forecasted annual effective tax rate and adjust for any discrete items arising during the
quarter. We recorded an income tax expense/(benefit) of $55 million and $29 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. During the
three months ended March 31, 2023, the income tax expense was primarily driven by our foreign operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the
income tax expense was primarily driven by our foreign operations, offset by the deferred U.S. tax impact related to our investment in Aurora. The primary
differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory tax rate are due to the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets and
foreign tax rate differences.
      During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $75 million, of which approximately $3 million of
unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The remaining $72 million of unrecognized tax benefits would not impact the
effective tax rate due to the valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets.
      We are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. We are also under routine examination by federal, various state and foreign
tax authorities. We believe that adequate amounts have been reserved in these jurisdictions. To the extent we have tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in
which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period. For
our major tax jurisdictions, the tax years 2007 through 2024 remain open; the major tax jurisdictions are the U.S., Brazil, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom
(“UK”).
      Although the timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits
could significantly change in the next 12 months. Given the number of years remaining subject to examination and the number of matters being examined, we are
unable to estimate the full range of possible adjustments to the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to unrecognized tax benefits recorded as of
March 31, 2024 that are reasonably possible to occur within the next 12 months are not expected to be material.
      In the event we experience an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), our ability to utilize net operating
losses, tax credits and other tax attributes may be limited. The most recent analysis of our historical ownership changes was completed through March 31, 2024.
Based on the analysis, we do not anticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.
      Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions’ deferred
tax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred
tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the
expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability
may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies.
      Based on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have sufficient evidence to release a
significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 12 months. However, our judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and
amount of any valuation allowance release are subject to change due to many factors, including future market conditions, the ability to successfully execute our
business plans, and the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future.
      Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would result in an income
tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.

# Quarterly Report - Net Income (Loss) Per Share

Basic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potential weighted average dilutive common stock. For diluted net income (loss) per share, the dilutive effect of outstanding awards is reflected by application of the treasury stock method and convertible securities by application of the if-converted method, as applicable.

We take into account the effect on consolidated net income (loss) per share of dilutive securities of entities in which we hold equity interests that are accounted for using the equity method.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Note 10 – Segment Information and Geographic Information

We determine our operating segments based on how the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) manages the business, allocates resources, makes operating decisions and evaluates operating performance.

# Operating Segments

Segment
Description

Mobility
Mobility products connect consumers with Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes, minibuses, or taxis. Mobility also includes activity related to our financial partnerships products and advertising.

Delivery
Delivery offerings allow consumers to search for and discover local restaurants, order a meal, and either pick-up at the restaurant or have the meal delivered. In certain markets, Delivery provides offerings for grocery, alcohol, and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We refer to the grocery, alcohol, convenience and retail categories collectively as Grocery & Retail. Delivery also includes advertising.

Freight
Freight connects Carriers with Shippers on our platform, and gives Carriers upfront, transparent pricing and the ability to book a shipment. Freight also includes transportation management and other logistics services offerings.

For information about how our reportable segments derive revenue, as well as revenue grouped by offerings and geographical region, refer to Note 2 – Revenue.

# Segment Adjusted EBITDA

Our segment operating performance measure is Segment Adjusted EBITDA. The CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset information and, accordingly, we do not report asset information by segment. Segment Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenue less the following expenses: cost of revenue, operations and support, sales and marketing, and general and administrative and research and development expenses associated with our segments. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also excludes non-cash items or items that management does not believe are reflective of our ongoing core operations.

# Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies

# Contingencies

From time to time, we are a party to various claims, non-income tax audits and litigation in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, we had recorded aggregate liabilities of $1.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $336 million and $238 million, respectively, relate to non-income tax matters in accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for all of our legal, regulatory and non-income tax matters that were probable and reasonably estimable.

We are currently party to various legal and regulatory matters that have arisen in the normal course of business and include, among others, alleged independent contractor misclassification claims, Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”) claims, alleged background check violations, pricing and advertising claims, unfair competition claims, intellectual property claims, employment discrimination and other employment-related claims, Telephone Consumer Protection Act (“TCPA”) claims, Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) claims, data and privacy claims, securities claims, antitrust claims, challenges to regulations, and other matters.

We have existing litigation, including class actions, Private Attorney General Act lawsuits, arbitration claims, and governmental administrative and audit proceedings, asserting claims by or on behalf of Drivers that Drivers are misclassified as independent contractors. In connection with the enactment of California State Assembly Bill 5 (“AB5”), we have received and expect to continue to receive - in California and in other jurisdictions - an increased number of misclassification claims. With respect to our outstanding legal and regulatory matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the ultimate amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The outcome of such legal matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's expectations, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

# Driver Classification

# California Attorney General Lawsuit

In January 2020, AB5 went into effect. AB5 codifies a test to determine whether a worker is an employee under California law. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity.

On May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court against Uber and Lyft, Inc. (“Lyft”). The complaint alleges drivers are misclassified, and seeks an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

On August 10, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction order, prohibiting us from classifying drivers as independent contractors and from violating various wage and hour laws. The injunction was stayed pending appeal. On October 22, 2020, the Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court’s ruling, and we filed a petition for review of the decision with the California Supreme Court. The petition was based upon the passage of Proposition 22 by California voters in November 2020, and requested that the Court of Appeal opinion be vacated because AB5’s application to Uber was superseded by Proposition 22.

Proposition 22 was a state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours to qualify as independent workers. As a result of the passage of Proposition 22, Drivers are able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law, and we and our competitors are required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Proposition 22 went into effect on December 16, 2020.

The California Supreme Court declined the petition for review on February 10, 2021. The lawsuit was returned to the trial court following the appellate proceedings on February 22, 2021. On April 12, 2021, the California Attorney General, Uber and Lyft filed a stipulation to dissolve the preliminary injunction with the trial court. On April 16, 2021, the trial court signed an order granting the stipulation. Although the preliminary injunction has been dissolved, the lawsuit remains ongoing relating to claims by the California Attorney General for periods prior to enactment of Proposition 22. The parties petitioned to stay this matter pending coordination with other California employment related matters, which was granted and a coordination judge was assigned. The case had been stayed pending appeal of the denial of a motion to compel arbitration, however the California Supreme Court denied review on January 17, 2024, and the case was remitted back to the Superior Court on January 29, 2024 for further proceedings. The case remains stayed. We intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.
# Quarterly Report - Legal Matters


# Castellanos v. State (Constitutional Challenge to Proposition 22)

In January 2021, a petition was filed with the California Supreme Court by several drivers and a labor union alleging that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which was denied. The same drivers and labor union have since filed a similar challenge in California Superior Court, and in August 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court ruled that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional. On September 21, 2021, the State of California filed an appeal of that decision with the California Court of Appeal, and the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services organization, who intervened in the matter, has also filed an appeal. Oral argument was heard on December 13, 2022.

On March 13, 2023, the California Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s ruling that Proposition 22 is unconstitutional, which means that Proposition 22 remains in effect. Service Employees International Union has petitioned the California Supreme Court for review. The California Supreme Court granted review on June 28, 2023, and has yet to schedule oral argument. We expect a decision in 2024.

# Massachusetts Attorney General Lawsuit

On July 9, 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint in Suffolk County Superior Court against Uber and Lyft. The complaint alleges Drivers are employees, and are entitled to protections under the wage and labor laws. Trial has been set for May 13, 2024. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain and the amount accrued for the matter is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

# Swiss Social Security Rulings

Several Swiss administrative bodies have issued decisions in which they classify Drivers as employees of Uber Switzerland, Rasier Operations B.V. or of Uber B.V. for social security or labor purposes. We are challenging each of them before the Social Security and Administrative Tribunals.

In April 2021, a ruling was made that Uber Switzerland could not be held liable for social security contributions. The litigations with regards to Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. are still pending for years 2014 to 2021. In January 2022, the Social Security Tribunal of Zurich reclassified drivers who have used the App in 2014 as dependent workers of Uber B.V. and Rasier Operations B.V. from a social security standpoint and this ruling had been appealed before the Federal Tribunal and had no impact on our current operations. On March 21, 2023, the Federal Tribunal ruled that Drivers who have used the Uber App in 2014 qualify as employees for social security purposes. Further discussions with the social security authorities are in progress.

On June 3, 2022, the Federal Tribunal issued two rulings by which both Drivers and Couriers in the Canton of Geneva are classified as employees of Uber B.V., Uber Portier B.V. and Uber Switzerland GmbH. Following the ruling of the Federal Tribunal on Eats, we received an injunction of payment from the Social Security authorities that states that couriers shall be considered employees for social security purposes since the launch of Uber Eats. We reached a settlement with the Canton of Geneva on Mobility with regards to social security implications.

On October 2, 2023, the Swiss Federal Tax authorities ruled that Drivers are independent contractors for VAT purposes, based on the changes implemented in the App since 2020. This decision will be used to support the Company’s position in the Social Security proceedings.

The ultimate resolution of the matters before the social security authorities is uncertain and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

# Other Driver Classification Matters

Additionally, we have received other lawsuits and governmental inquiries in other jurisdictions, and anticipate future claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, and government investigations and audits challenging our classification of Drivers as independent contractors and not employees. We believe that our current and historical approach to classification is supported by the law and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. However, the results of litigation and arbitration are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to these claims, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Regardless of the outcome, litigation and arbitration of these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources and other factors.

# State Unemployment Taxes

# New Jersey Department of Labor

In 2018, the New Jersey Department of Labor (“NJDOL”) opened an audit reviewing whether Drivers were independent contractors or employees for purposes of determining whether unemployment insurance regulations apply from 2014 through 2018. The NJDOL made an assessment on November 12, 2019, against both Rasier and Uber. Both assessments were calculated through November 15, 2019, but only calculated the alleged contributions, penalties, and interests owed from 2014 through 2018.

# Quarterly Report

The provided document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Legal and Regulatory Matters

# New Jersey Department of Labor (NJ DOL)

The NJ DOL has initiated an audit for the period of 2019 through the second quarter of 2023. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain, and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

# California Employment Development Department (CA EDD)

In 2014, the CA EDD opened an audit to review whether drivers should be treated as employees or independent contractors. The department issued an assessment in 2016 for the periods of 2013 - 2015, and we have since reached an agreement for this period. In 2022, we received requests for information related to an audit covering the fourth quarter of 2017 through the fourth quarter of 2020. We are also appealing an assessment received in June 2023 for the years 2018 - 2020 covering couriers who used the Postmates platform. The ultimate resolution of the matter is uncertain, and the amount accrued for those matters is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

# Other Matters

# IPO Securities Litigation

Beginning in September 2019, putative class actions were filed against us, our directors, certain officers, and the underwriters named in our IPO registration statement, alleging violations of securities laws in connection with our May 2019 IPO. The remaining actions have been consolidated in the Northern District of California, which granted Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in July 2022. On April 24, 2024, the parties informed the court that they are negotiating a settlement agreement, and the court stayed the litigation. The ultimate resolution of these matters is uncertain and the amount accrued is recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2024.

# Non-Income Tax Matters

We recorded an estimated liability for contingencies related to non-income tax matters and are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. The subject matter of these contingent liabilities primarily arises from the characterization for tax purposes of transactions on the platform, as well as the application of certain employee benefits and employment and income taxes to our Drivers and Couriers.

# United Kingdom

On October 31, 2022, we settled our UK VAT dispute with HMRC for all periods prior to March 14, 2022, making a payment of approximately $733 million (£613 million) in the fourth quarter of 2022. As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, and Uber UK is now required to remit VAT. We have received multiple assessments from HMRC disputing our application of VAT Order 1987 for the period of March 2022 to September 2023, totaling approximately $981 million (£781 million) for unpaid VAT. The payments made in 2023 and 2024 are recorded as a receivable in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet, as we believe we will be successful in our appeal.
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report


# Legal and Regulatory Matters

# Brazil

In May 2023, we received an assessment for 2019 and 2020 Driver social security contributions from the Brazilian Federal Revenue Bureau (“FRB”). We are contesting the assessment and we filed our administrative appeal with the FRB in June 2023. In April 2024, we received a positive decision from the FRB. This decision and the subsequent decision can be appealed at multiple levels by the FRB or Uber. Our chances of success on the merits are still uncertain and any reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be estimated.

# Other Legal and Regulatory Matters

We have been or are currently subject to various government inquiries and investigations surrounding the legality of certain of our business practices, compliance with antitrust, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws (including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act) and other global regulatory requirements, labor laws, securities laws, data protection and privacy laws, consumer protection laws, environmental laws, and the infringement of certain intellectual property rights. We are investigating many of these matters and are implementing a number of recommendations to our managerial, operational and compliance practices, as well as strengthening our overall governance structure. In many cases, we are unable to predict the outcomes and implications of these inquiries and investigations on our business, which could be time consuming, costly to investigate, and require significant management attention. Furthermore, the outcome of these inquiries and investigations could negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results, including possible fines and penalties and requiring changes to operational activities and procedures.

We have been and expect to continue to be subject to personal injury claims for compensation based on traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, or other incidents that are caused by Drivers, consumers, or third parties while using our platform, or even when Drivers, consumers, or third parties are not actively using our platform. Various plaintiffs have also coordinated and may in the future attempt to coordinate individual injury claims in various jurisdictions. We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms to provide for personal injury risks. Our insurance reserves include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us related to these claims.

# Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we often include standard indemnification provisions in our arrangements with third parties. Pursuant to these provisions, we may be obligated to indemnify such parties for losses or claims suffered or incurred in connection with their activities or non-compliance with certain representations and warranties made by us. In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with our officers, directors, and certain current and former employees, and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain indemnification obligations. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential loss under these indemnification provisions / obligations because of the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular situation.

# Note 12 – Variable Interest Entities

# Consolidated VIEs

Variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are legal entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without future subordinated financial support. We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. We are the primary beneficiary because we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these VIEs. As a result, we consolidate the assets and liabilities of these VIEs.

Total assets included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for our consolidated VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 were $3.5 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Total liabilities included on the condensed consolidated balance sheets for these VIEs as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 were $755 million and $786 million, respectively.

# Uber Freight Holding Corporation

As of March 31, 2024, we own the majority of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Uber Freight Holding Corporation (“Freight Holding”) and report a non-controlling interest as further described in Note 13 – Non-Controlling Interests.

In February 2023, Freight Holding entered into a $300 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility guaranteed by the assets of Freight Holding and is considered non-recourse to us. As of March 31, 2024, there was no balance outstanding on Freight Holding’s revolving credit facility.

# Unconsolidated VIEs

We do not consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest but are not the primary beneficiary because we lack the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entities’ economic performance. Our carrying amounts of both assets and liabilities recognized on the condensed consolidated balance sheets related to unconsolidated VIEs were $575 million and $550 million as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024 our maximum exposure to loss was $686 million and $661 million, respectively.

# Investments and Related Parties

# Lime

Neutron Holdings, Inc. (“Lime”) is incorporated in Delaware for the purpose of owning and operating a fleet of dockless e-bikes and e-scooters for short-term access use by consumers for personal transportation. In 2020, we entered into a series of transactions and agreements with Lime to divest our JUMP business and acquired ownership in Lime comprised of Lime Common Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock, Lime 1-C Preferred Stock Warrants, and the Lime Convertible Note (collectively, the “2020 Lime Investments”). We are exposed to Lime’s economic risks and rewards through the related carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financial guarantees, which represent variable interests.

# Moove

On February 12, 2021 (the “Moove Closing Date”), we entered into and completed a series of agreements with Garment Investments S.L. dba Moove (“Moove”), a vehicle fleet operator in Spain. The series of agreements included:

- An equity investment, through preferred shares, in which Uber acquired a 30% minority interest in Moove from its current shareholders at closing and up to approximately $185 million contingent on future performance of Moove and certain other conditions through the eighth anniversary of the agreement.
- A term loan of $213 million to Moove, due February 2026.
- A commercial partnership agreement.

Also included in the agreements is an option for us to purchase common stock of Moove at fair value, beginning two years after the Moove Closing Date. As of March 31, 2024, we have not exercised this option. After this series of agreements, Moove is considered a related party.

In February 2023, we entered into a settlement and amendment agreement (“Moove Settlement”) with Moove, a related party, to settle certain contingent considerations agreements. As a result of the Moove Settlement, we made an immaterial payment to Moove. The remaining contingent liability was recorded within accrued and other current liabilities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet and was not material. The contingent liability was paid in January 2024.

Our equity investment in Moove, through preferred shares, is accounted for as an investment in non-marketable equity securities included in investments on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The term loan, of $278 million as of March 31, 2024, is accounted for as a loan receivable, carried at amortized cost, and included in other assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 – Investments and Fair Value Measurement, Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis, for additional information regarding our non-marketable equity securities.

Moove is a VIE as it lacks sufficient equity to finance its activities without future subordinated financial support. We are exposed to Moove’s economic risks and rewards through the related carrying amount of assets and liabilities and any financial guarantees, which represent variable interests.

# Non-Controlling Interests

# Freight Holding

As of both December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, we owned 74% of the issued and outstanding capital stock of our subsidiary Freight Holding, or 72% on a fully-diluted basis if all common shares reserved for issuance under our Freight Holding employee incentive plan were issued and outstanding. The minority stockholders of Freight Holding include:

- Holders of Freight Holding’s Series A and A-1 Preferred Stock;
- Holders of common equity awards issued under the employee equity incentive plans;
- Employees who hold fully vested shares.

# Freight Holding Supplier Financing Program

Freight Holding utilizes a third-party financial institution that allows our suppliers to be paid by the third-party financial institution earlier than the due date on the applicable invoice at a discounted price. In general, supplier invoices financed by the third-party financial institution are due for payment by Freight Holding within thirty days. As of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, the liability related to the supplier financing program was immaterial and the amounts are included within accounts payable on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

# ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should review the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of forward-looking statements and Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

# Overview

We are a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings on our platform. We connect consumers with providers of ride services, merchants as well as delivery service providers for meal preparation, grocery and other delivery services. Uber also connects consumers with public transportation networks. We use this same network, technology, operational excellence, and product expertise to connect Shippers with Carriers in the freight industry by providing Carriers with the ability to book a shipment, transportation management and other logistics services. We are also developing technologies designed to provide new solutions to solve everyday problems.

# Driver Classification Developments

The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. Of particular note are proceedings in California, where on May 5, 2020, the California Attorney General, in conjunction with the city attorneys for San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego, filed a complaint in San Francisco Superior Court (the “Court”) against Uber and Lyft, Inc., alleging that drivers are misclassified, and sought an injunction and monetary damages related to the alleged competitive advantage caused by the alleged misclassification of drivers.

To comply with Proposition 22, we have incurred and expect to incur additional expenses, including expenses associated with a guaranteed minimum earnings floor for Drivers, insurance for injury protection and subsidies for health care. We do not expect these changes will have a material impact on our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.

If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform. Any of these events could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.

For a discussion of risk factors related to how misclassification challenges may impact our business, result of operations, financial position and operating condition and cash flows, see the risk factor titled “-Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees” included in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors”, and Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

In addition, if we are required to classify Drivers as employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# Highlights for the First Quarter 2024

In the first quarter of 2024, our MAPCs were 149 million, growing 15% compared to the same period in 2023. Overall Gross Bookings increased to $37.7 billion in the first quarter of 2024, up 20%, or 21% on a constant currency basis, compared to the same period in 2023. Mobility Gross Bookings grew 26% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis primarily due to an increase in Trip volumes. Delivery Gross Bookings grew 17% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by an increase in delivery orders and higher basket sizes. Freight Gross Bookings decreased 9% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, due to lower revenue per load as a result of the challenging freight market cycle.

Revenue was $10.1 billion, up 15% year-over-year, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 20%. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility Trip volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which negatively impacted revenue by $328 million and $414 million across Mobility and Delivery, respectively.

Net loss attributable to Uber Technologies, Inc. was $654 million, which includes the unfavorable impact of a pre-tax unrealized loss on debt and equity securities, net of $721 million primarily related to a $505 million unrealized loss on our Aurora investment, a $123 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment, and a $69 million unrealized loss on our Didi investment.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1.4 billion, up $621 million compared to the same period in 2023. Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.5 billion, up $419 million compared to the same period in 2023. Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit was $528 million, up $240 million compared to the same period in 2023. These increases were partially offset by a $40 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs, year-over-year.

We ended the quarter with $5.8 billion in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments.

# Components of Results of Operations

# Revenue

We generate substantially all of our revenue from fees paid by Drivers and Merchants for use of our platform. We have concluded that we are an agent in these arrangements as we arrange for other parties to provide the service to the end-user. Under this model, revenue is net of Driver and Merchant earnings and Driver incentives. We act as an agent in these transactions by connecting consumers to Drivers and Merchants to facilitate a Trip, meal, grocery or other delivery service.

In certain markets we are responsible for the Mobility or Delivery services (and in most markets we are responsible for the Freight services), and in these markets we present revenue from end-users and from Shippers on a gross basis, with the payments to Drivers and Carriers classified within cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

We would expect revenue to fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future based upon factors such as Trip volume, Driver supply, macroeconomic conditions, global travel activities and management pricing and promotional activities. During the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-users becoming our customers. Promotions to end-users considered customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to end-users not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses.

# Quarterly Report for Uber Technologies, Inc.

# Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

# Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition

For additional discussion related to our revenue, see the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Revenue Recognition” as well as “Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Revenue Recognition,” and “Note 2 – Revenue” to our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 and Note 2 – Revenue in this Quarterly Report in Form 10-Q.

# Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, primarily consists of costs incurred for certain Mobility and Delivery transactions where we are primarily responsible for Mobility and Delivery services and pay Drivers and Couriers for services, certain insurance costs related to our Mobility and Delivery offerings, costs incurred with Carriers for Uber Freight transportation services, credit card processing fees, bank fees, data center and networking expenses, mobile device and service costs, and amounts related to fare chargebacks and other credit card losses.

We expect that cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, will fluctuate on an absolute dollar basis for the foreseeable future in line with Trip volume changes on the platform.

# Operations and Support

Operations and support expenses primarily consist of compensation expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees that support operations in cities, including the general managers, Driver operations, platform user support representatives and community managers. Also included is the cost of customer support, Driver background checks and the allocation of certain corporate costs.

We would expect operations and support expenses to vary from period to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we become more efficient in supporting platform users.

# Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising costs, product marketing costs, consumer discounts, promotions, credits and refunds provided to end-users who are not customers, compensation costs, including stock-based compensation to sales and marketing employees, and the allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense advertising and other promotional expenditures as incurred.

We would expect sales and marketing expenses to vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue due to timing of marketing campaigns.

During the year ended December 31, 2023, we implemented a business model change in certain major markets resulting in end-users becoming our customers. Promotions to end-users considered customers are recognized as contra-revenue while promotions to end-users not considered customers are recognized as sales and marketing expenses.

# Research and Development

Research and development expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for employees in engineering, design and product development. Expenses also include ongoing improvements to, and maintenance of, existing products and services, and allocation of certain corporate costs. We expense substantially all research and development expenses as incurred.

We would expect research and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and vary from period to period as a percentage of revenue as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to ongoing improvements to and maintenance of our platform offerings and other research and development programs.

# General and Administrative

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, for executive management and administrative employees, including finance and accounting, human resources, policy and communications, legal, and certain impairment charges, as well as allocation of certain corporate costs, occupancy, and general corporate insurance costs. General and administrative expenses also include certain legal-related accruals and expenses.

We would expect general and administrative expenses to vary from period to period on an absolute dollar basis, but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we achieve improved fixed cost leverage and efficiencies in our internal support functions.

# Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation on buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, software, leasehold improvements, furniture and fixtures, and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with buildings, site improvements, computer and network equipment, and furniture, fixtures, as well as leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized internal-use software and acquired intangible assets.
      Interest Expense
      Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with our outstanding debt, including accretion of debt discount. For additional detail related
to our debt obligations, see Note 5 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included
in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
      Other Income (Expense), Net
      Other income (expense), net primarily includes the following items:
        •       Interest income, which consists primarily of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash and cash
                equivalents and restricted investments.
        •       Foreign currency exchange losses, net, which consist primarily of remeasurement of transactions and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in
                currencies other than the functional currency at the end of the period.
        •       Unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net, which consists primarily of gains (losses) from fair value adjustments relating to our
                marketable and non-marketable securities.
        •       Other, net.
      Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes
      We are subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which we do business. These foreign jurisdictions have different statutory tax
rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be taxable in the United States. Accordingly, our effective tax rate will
vary depending on the relative proportion of foreign to domestic income, changes in the valuation allowance on our U.S. and Netherlands' deferred tax assets, and
changes in tax laws.
      Based on available evidence, management believes it is not more-likely-than-not that the net U.S., Netherlands, and other non-material jurisdictions’ deferred
tax assets will be fully realizable. In these jurisdictions, we have recorded a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. We regularly review the deferred
tax assets for recoverability based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the
expected timing of the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and tax planning strategies by jurisdiction. Our judgment regarding future profitability
may change due to many factors, including future market conditions and the ability to successfully execute our business plans and/or tax planning strategies.
      Based on our assessment of current income and anticipated future earnings, there is a reasonable possibility that we will have sufficient evidence to release a
significant portion of the valuation allowance in the U.S. within the next 12 months. However, our judgment regarding future earnings and the exact timing and
amount of any valuation allowance release are subject to change due to many factors, including future market conditions, the ability to successfully execute our
business plans, and the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the future.
      Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of net deferred tax assets on our consolidated balance sheet and would result in an income
tax benefit in the period the release is recorded.
      In addition, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) has led international efforts among approximately 140 countries and
taxing jurisdictions to propose and implement changes to numerous long-standing tax principles, including a framework that imposes a minimum tax rate of 15% in
each taxing jurisdiction. Under this guidance, we will be required to determine a combined effective tax rate for all entities located in a jurisdiction. If the
jurisdictional effective tax rate determined under these rules is less than 15%, a top-up tax will be due to bring the jurisdictional effective tax rate up to 15%. We
are continuing to monitor the pending implementation of these rules by individual countries and the potential impact on our business. We expect the provisions
effective in 2024 to have an insignificant impact on our tax obligations for 2024.
      Income (Loss) from Equity Method Investments
      Income (loss) from equity method investments primarily includes the results of our share of income or loss from our equity method investments.

# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Revenue

|Three Months Ended March 31|2023|2024|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Revenue (in millions)|$8,823|$10,131|15%|

Revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 15%, primarily attributable to an increase in Gross Bookings of 20%. The increase in Gross Bookings was primarily driven by an increase in Mobility Trip volumes. The increase in revenue was partially offset by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which negatively impacted revenue by $328 million and $414 million across Mobility and Delivery, respectively.

# Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

|Three Months Ended March 31|2023|2024|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization (in millions)|$5,259|$6,168|17%|

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $909 million, or 17%, mainly due to a $337 million increase in insurance expense primarily due to an increase in miles driven in our Mobility business, a $329 million increase in Driver payments and incentives, and a $178 million increase in Courier payments and incentives.

# Operations and Support

|Three Months Ended March 31|2023|2024|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Operations and support (in millions)|$640|$685|7%|

# Sales and Marketing

|Three Months Ended March 31|2023|2024|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Sales and marketing (in millions)|$1,262|$917|(27%)|

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $345 million, or 27%, primarily due to a $335 million decrease in consumer discounts, promotions, credits, and refunds.

# Research and Development

|Three Months Ended March 31|2023|2024|% Change|
|---|---|---|---|
|Research and development (in millions)|$775|$790|2%|

Research and development expenses increased $15 million, or 2%, primarily attributable to a $9 million increase in stock-based compensation and an $8 million increase in employee headcount costs.

|Adjusted EBITDA(2)|$761|$1,382|82%|

# Notes:

(1) Includes costs that are not directly attributable to our reportable segments. Corporate G&A also includes certain shared costs such as finance, accounting, tax, human resources, information technology, and legal costs. Platform R&D also includes mapping and payment technologies and support and development of the internal technology infrastructure. Our allocation methodology is periodically evaluated and may change.

(2) See the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for more information and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.

# Mobility Segment

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, Mobility revenue increased $1.3 billion, or 30%, and Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit increased $419 million, or 40%.

Mobility revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings of 25%, driven by an increase in Trip volumes. The increase in Mobility revenue was partially offset by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which negatively impacted revenue by $328 million.

Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Mobility Gross Bookings, partially offset by a $337 million increase in insurance expense primarily due to an increase in miles driven and a $329 million increase in Driver payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.

# Delivery Segment

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, Delivery revenue increased $121 million, or 4%, and Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit increased $240 million, or 83%.

Delivery revenue increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery Gross Bookings of 18%, driven by an increase in delivery orders and higher basket sizes. The increase in Delivery revenue was partially offset by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue, which negatively impacted revenue by $414 million.

Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit increased primarily attributable to an increase in Delivery revenue including advertising, partially offset by a $178 million increase in Courier payments and incentives that are recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and a $68 million increase in insurance expense primarily due to an increase in miles driven.

# Freight Segment

For the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, Freight revenue decreased $116 million, or 8%, and Freight Adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million, or 9%.

Freight revenue decreased primarily attributable to a decrease in Freight Gross Bookings due to lower revenue per load as a result of the challenging freight market cycle.

Freight Adjusted EBITDA loss decreased primarily attributable to a $108 million decrease in Freight Carrier payments recorded in cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $116 million decrease in Freight revenue.

# Certain Key Metrics and Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency, and free cash flow are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information about how we use these non-GAAP financial measures in our business, the limitations of these measures, and reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, see the section titled “Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs) is the number of unique consumers who completed a Mobility ride or received a Delivery order on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter. While a unique consumer can use multiple product offerings on our platform in a given month, that unique consumer is counted as only one MAPC. We use MAPCs to assess the adoption of our platform and frequency of transactions, which are key factors in our penetration of the countries in which we operate.

Management Discussion

Adjusted EBITDA profit was $1.4 billion, improving $621 million from an Adjusted EBITDA profit of $761 million from the same period in 2023. The improvement was primarily attributable to a $419 million increase in Mobility Adjusted EBITDA profit and a $240 million improvement in Delivery Adjusted EBITDA profit, partially offset by a $40 million increase in Corporate G&A and Platform R&D costs.

Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures

We collect and analyze operating and financial data to evaluate the health of our business and assess our performance. In addition to revenue, net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, and other results under GAAP, we use Adjusted EBITDA, revenue growth rates in constant currency, and free cash flow to evaluate our business. These non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring core business operating results.

Definition of Adjusted EBITDA

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), excluding various items such as income (loss) from discontinued operations, net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, provision for income taxes, interest expense, and other non-cash expenses.

It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Adjusted EBITDA Reconciliation

Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, should be considered as supplemental in nature, and is not meant as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. These limitations include the following:

- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain recurring, non-cash charges, such as depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, and although these are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect all cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;
- Adjusted EBITDA excludes stock-based compensation expense, which has been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense in our business and an important part of our compensation strategy;
- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain restructuring and related charges, part of which may be settled in cash;
- Adjusted EBITDA excludes other items not indicative of our ongoing operating performance;
- Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect period-to-period changes in taxes, income tax expense or the cash necessary to pay income taxes;
- Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the components of other income (expense), net, which primarily includes: interest income; foreign currency exchange gains (losses), net; and unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net;
- Adjusted EBITDA excludes certain legal, tax, and regulatory reserve changes and settlements that may reduce cash available to us.

# Constant Currency

We compare the percent change in our current period results from the corresponding prior period using constant currency disclosure. We present constant currency growth rate information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying revenue performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. We calculate constant currency by translating our current period financial results using the corresponding prior period’s monthly exchange rates for our transacted currencies other than the U.S. dollar.

# Liquidity and Capital Resources

# Three Months Ended March 31

|(In millions)|2023|2024|
|---|---|---|
|Net cash provided by operating activities|$606|$1,416|
|Net cash used in investing activities|($399)|($242)|
|Net cash used in financing activities|($107)|($100)|

# Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily consisting of $663 million of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included: $721 million in unrealized losses on debt and equity securities, net; $484 million of stock-based compensation expense; and $194 million of depreciation and amortization expense. In addition, cash consumed by working capital decreased by $575 million. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves and accrued expenses and other liabilities, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets.

Net cash provided by operating activities was $606 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily consisting of $157 million of net loss, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily included: $470 million of stock-based compensation expense; $320 million in unrealized gains on debt and equity securities, net; and $207 million of depreciation and amortization expense as well as a $258 million decrease in cash consumed by working capital. The decrease in cash consumed by working capital was primarily driven by an increase in our accrued insurance reserves and a decrease in accounts receivable, partially offset by a decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities.

# Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $242 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $2.0 billion, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $174 million, and $57 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $2.0 billion.

Net cash used in investing activities was $399 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $846 million, and $57 million in purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $500 million.

# Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities was $100 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024, primarily consisting of $42 million of principal payments of finance leases.

Net cash used in financing activities was $107 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily consisting of $40 million of principal payments of finance leases and a $16 million net cash outflow related to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, comprised of (i) $1.1 billion cash inflow from the issuance of the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, net of issuance costs, from new lenders and additional principal from existing lenders; (ii) a $1.1 billion cash outflow of principal payments on the 2025 Refinanced Term Loan and 2027 Refinanced Term Loan to exiting lenders and lower principal from existing lenders. For additional information on our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans, see Note 5 – Long-Term Debt and Revolving Credit Arrangements in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

# Other Information

As of March 31, 2024, $2.6 billion of our $5.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Cash held outside the United States may be repatriated, subject to certain limitations, and would be available to be used to fund our domestic operations. Repatriation of funds may result in immaterial tax liabilities. We believe that our existing cash balance in the United States is sufficient to fund our working capital needs in the United States. We are in compliance with our debt and line of credit covenants as of March 31, 2024, including by meeting our reporting obligations. We also believe that our sources of funding and our available line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital requirements, collateral requirements, potential acquisitions, potential prepayments of contested indirect tax assessments (“pay-to-play”), and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months. We intend to continue to evaluate and may, in certain circumstances, take preemptive action to preserve liquidity.
# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.


# Non-Income Tax Matters

As of March 14, 2022, we modified our operating model in the UK, such that as of that date Uber UK is a merchant of transportation and is required to remit VAT. Uber UK is remitting VAT under the Value Added (Tour Operators) Order 1987 (“VAT Order 1987”), which allows for VAT remittance on a calculated margin, rather than on Gross Bookings.

We have received multiple assessments from the HMRC disputing our application of VAT Order 1987 application for the period of March 2022 to September 2023, totaling approximately $981 million (£781 million) for unpaid VAT. Uber paid the assessments in order to proceed with the appeal process. The payments do not represent our acceptance of the assessments. The payments are recorded as a receivable because we believe that we will be successful in our appeal, upon which, the full amount of our payments will be returned to us with interest upon completion of the appeals process. We expect to receive additional assessments related to prior or future periods, which we will be required to pay in order to continue with the appeals process. Any payments are expected to decrease operating cash flow and have no impact on our results of operations. We plan to vigorously defend our application of the VAT Order 1987 and are waiting to obtain hearing dates from the Tax Tribunal.

# Commitments

We have non-cancelable commitments which primarily relate to network and cloud services and other items in the ordinary course of business. These amounts are determined based on the non-cancelable quantities to which we are contractually obligated. As of March 31, 2024, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the contractual obligations, as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# Critical Accounting Estimates

Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.

For additional information about our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the disclosure included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K as well as Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1, of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

# Recent Accounting Pronouncements

See Note 1 – Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

# ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business. These risks primarily include interest rate risk, investment risk, and foreign currency risk as follows:

# Interest Rate Risk

Our exposures to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. The 2030 Refinanced Term Loans represent floating rate notes and are carried at amortized cost. Therefore, fluctuations in interest rates will impact our condensed consolidated financial statements. The interest rate for the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans is SOFR subject to a floor of 0.00%, plus 2.75% per annum. There is no cap on the interest rate associated with the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. A rising interest rate environment will increase the amount of interest paid on the 2030 Refinanced Term Loans. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

The fair value of our fixed rate notes will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our notes by $212 million as of March 31, 2024.

# Investment Risk

Our investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Cash deposits typically exceed insured limits and are placed with financial institutions around the world that we believe are of high credit quality. These deposits are in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance limits. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the FDIC limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis.
# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.


# Investment Policy Objective

Our investment policy objective aims to preserve capital and meet liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk. We had cash and cash equivalents including restricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $7.0 billion and $8.0 billion as of December 31, 2023 and March 31, 2024, respectively.

Marketable debt securities classified as restricted investments and short-term investments totaled $5.6 billion as of March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2024, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable debt securities primarily consist of money market funds, cash deposits, U.S. government securities, U.S. government agency securities, and investment-grade corporate debt securities. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Investments in fixed rate securities carry a degree of interest rate risk. Changes in rates would primarily impact interest income due to the relatively short-term nature of our investments. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial results.

# Investment Risks

We are exposed to certain risks related to the carrying amounts of investments in other companies, including our minority-owned, privately-held affiliates and public companies, compared to their fair value. We hold privately held investments in illiquid private company stock which are inherently difficult to value given the lack of publicly available information. We also hold equity securities with readily determinable fair values which are subject to equity price risk. These investments in privately-held affiliates and recently public companies may increase the volatility in our net income/(loss) in future periods due to changes in the fair value of these investments. In certain cases, our ability to sell these investments may be impacted by contractual obligations to hold the securities for a set period of time after a public offering. As of March 31, 2024, the carrying value of our investments was $5.9 billion, including equity method investments.

# Foreign Currency Risk

We transact business globally in multiple currencies. Our international revenue, as well as costs and expenses denominated in foreign currencies, expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar. We are exposed to foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates may negatively affect our future revenue and other operating results as expressed in U.S. dollars. Our foreign currency risk is partially mitigated as our revenue recognized in currencies other than the U.S. dollar is diversified across geographic regions and we incur expenses in the same currencies in such regions.

We have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income/(loss) as a result of transaction gains or (losses) related to remeasurement of our asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. At this time, we do not, but we may in the future, enter into derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk.

# ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

# Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level.

# Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

# Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, believes that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and are effective at the reasonable assurance level. However, our management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

# Quarterly Report - Legal Proceedings

# ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We are a party to various legal actions and government investigations, and similar or other actions could be brought against us in the future. The most significant of these matters are described below.

# Legal Proceedings Described in Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes information on legal proceedings that constitute material contingencies for financial reporting purposes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, liquidity or results of operations if they were resolved in a manner that is adverse to us. This item should be read in conjunction with Note 11 for information regarding the following material legal proceedings, which information is incorporated into this item by reference:

- Driver Classification
- State Unemployment Taxes

# Legal Proceedings That Are Not Described in Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to Our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

In addition to the matters that are identified in Note 11 – Commitments and Contingencies to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and incorporated into this item by reference, the following matters also constitute material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary course litigation incidental to our business, to which we are or any of our subsidiaries is a party.

# Australia Class Actions

In May 2019, an Australian law firm filed a class action in the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, against us and certain of our subsidiaries, on behalf of certain participants in the taxi, hire-car, and limousine industries. The plaintiff alleges that the Uber entities conspired to injure the group members during the period 2014 to 2017 by either directly breaching transport legislation or commissioning offenses against transport legislation by UberX Drivers in Australia. The claim alleges, in effect, that these operations caused loss and damage to the class representative and class members, including lost income and decreased value of certain taxi licenses. In March, April and October 2020, the same Australian law firm filed four additional class action lawsuits alleging the same claim. In March 2024, the class action was settled with no admission of liability by Uber. Such settlement is pending court approval.

# Other Legal Proceedings

While it is not possible to determine the outcome of the legal actions, investigations, and proceedings brought against us, we believe that, except for the matters described above, the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity, but could be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period. We are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, litigation, claims, and government investigations in the ordinary course of business. In addition, the nature of our business exposes us to claims related to the classification of Drivers and the compliance of our business with applicable law. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions outside the United States where we may be less protected under local laws than we are in the United States. Although the results of the legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations in which we are involved cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not believe that the final outcome of these matters is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results. Regardless of final outcomes, however, any such legal proceedings, claims, and government investigations may nonetheless impose a significant burden on management and employees and may come with costly defense costs or unfavorable preliminary and interim rulings.

# ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Certain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. You should carefully consider the following risks, together with all of the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including the sections titled “Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the following risks could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, which would cause you to lose all or part of your investment. Our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material.

# Risk Factor Summary

The following are some of these risks, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition, operating results, or prospects.

- Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees instead of independent contractors.
- The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region.
- To remain competitive in certain markets, we have in the past lowered, and may continue to lower, fares or service fees, and we have in the past offered, and may continue to offer, significant Driver incentives and consumer discounts and promotions.
- We have incurred significant losses, including in the United States and other major markets. We expect our operating expenses to increase in the foreseeable future, and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.
- If we are unable to attract or maintain a critical mass of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, whether as a result of competition or other factors, our platform will become less appealing to platform users.
- Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business.
- Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, failure to maintain and enhance our brand and reputation will cause our business to suffer.
- Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges and our efforts to address these challenges may not be successful.
- If we are unable to optimize our organizational structure or effectively manage our growth, our financial performance and future prospects will be adversely affected.
- Platform users may engage in, or be subject to, criminal, violent, inappropriate, or dangerous activity that results in major safety incidents, which may harm our ability to attract and retain Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers.
- We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, and may increase such investments in the future. These new ventures are inherently risky, and we may never realize any expected benefits from them.
- We generate a significant percentage of our Gross Bookings from trips in large metropolitan areas, and these operations may be negatively affected by economic, social, weather, and regulatory conditions, public health concerns or other circumstances.
- We may fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform, fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or such technologies may fail to perform as expected, may be inferior to those offered by our competitors, or may be perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles.
- We have experienced and may experience security or data privacy breaches or other unauthorized or improper access to, use of, alteration of or destruction of our proprietary or confidential data, employee data, or platform user data.
- Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, and phishing attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results.
- Our growing use of artificial intelligence and machine learning may present additional risks, including risks associated with algorithm development or use, the tools and data sets used, and/or a complex, developing regulatory environment.
- We are subject to climate change risks, including physical and transitional risks, and if we are unable to manage such risks, our business may be adversely impacted.
- Increased attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, environment, social and governance and sustainability matters may impact our business, reputation and liabilities, including in the context of certain commitments we have made.
- Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation.

# Risks Related to Our Business

- We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.
- We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all.
- If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed, and any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected or be effectively integrated.
- We may continue to be blocked from or limited in providing or operating our products and offerings in certain jurisdictions, and may be required to modify our business model in those jurisdictions as a result.
- Our business is subject to numerous legal and regulatory risks that could have an adverse impact on our business and future prospects.
- Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight relating to the provision of payment and financial services.
- We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which have resulted and may result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.
- If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, or if third parties are successful in claiming that we are misappropriating the intellectual property of others, we may incur significant expense and our business may be adversely affected.
- The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

# Operational and Economic Risks Related to Our Business

# Operational Risks

Our business would be adversely affected if Drivers were classified as employees, workers or quasi-employees.

The classification of Drivers is currently being challenged in courts, by legislators and by government agencies in the United States and abroad. We are involved in numerous legal proceedings globally, including putative class and collective class action lawsuits, demands for arbitration, charges and claims before administrative agencies, and investigations or audits by labor, social security, and tax authorities that claim that Drivers should be treated as our employees (or as workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist), rather than as independent contractors. We believe that Drivers are independent contractors because, among other things, they can choose whether, when, and where to provide services on our platform, are free to provide services on our competitors’ platforms, and provide a vehicle to perform services on our platform. Nevertheless, we may not be successful in defending the classification of Drivers in some or all jurisdictions.

Furthermore, the costs associated with defending, settling, or resolving pending and future lawsuits (including demands for arbitration) relating to the classification of Drivers have been and may continue to be material to our business.

In addition, more than 150,000 Drivers in the United States who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed (or expressed an intention to file) arbitration demands against us that assert similar classification claims. We have resolved the classification claims of a majority of these Drivers under individual settlement agreements. Furthermore, we are involved in numerous legal proceedings regarding the enforceability of arbitration agreements entered into with Drivers. If we are not successful in such proceedings, this could negatively impact the enforceability of arbitration agreements in other legal proceedings, which could have an adverse consequence on our business and financial condition.

Changes to foreign, state, and local laws governing the definition or classification of independent contractors, or judicial decisions regarding independent contractor classification, could require classification of Drivers as employees (or workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist) and/or representation of Drivers by labor unions. For example, California’s Assembly Bill 5 became effective as of January 1, 2020. Government authorities and private plaintiffs have brought litigation asserting that Assembly Bill 5 requires Drivers in California to be classified as employees.

In November 2020, California voters approved Proposition 22, a California state ballot initiative that provides a framework for drivers that use platforms like ours for independent work. Proposition 22 went into effect in December 2020 and we expect that Drivers will be able to maintain their status as independent contractors under California law and that we and our competitors will be required to comply with the provisions of Proposition 22. Although our stipulation to dissolve the California Attorney General’s preliminary injunction was granted in April 2021, that litigation remains pending, and we also may face liability relating to periods.

# Quarterly Report

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Legal Challenges and Business Model Implications

Before the effective date of Proposition 22, legal challenges, including constitutional challenges, to Proposition 22 have been and may continue to be filed. We face similar challenges in other jurisdictions within the United States and abroad. For example, in July 2020, the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint against Uber and Lyft, alleging that drivers are misclassified, and seeking an injunction.

If we do not prevail in current litigation or similar actions that may be brought in the future, we may be required to treat Drivers as employees and/or make other changes to our business model in certain jurisdictions. If, as a result of legislation or judicial decisions, we are required to classify Drivers as employees, we would incur significant additional expenses for compensating Drivers, including expenses associated with the application of wage and hour laws (including minimum wage, overtime, and meal and rest period requirements), employee benefits, social security contributions, taxes (direct and indirect), and potential penalties.

In this case, we anticipate significant price increases for Riders to offset these additional costs; however, we believe that the financial impact to Uber would be moderated by the likelihood of other industry participants being similarly affected. Additionally, we may not have adequate Driver supply as Drivers may opt out of our platform given the loss of flexibility under an employment model, and we may not be able to hire a majority of the Drivers currently using our platform.

Further, any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model, and consequently have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

# Judicial Decisions and Employment Status

Other examples of judicial decisions include a decision by the French Supreme Court that a driver for a third-party meal delivery service was under a “subordinate relationship” of the service, indicating an employment relationship, a decision by the French Supreme Court that reclassified an UberX Driver as an employee (which has been followed by inconsistent appellate decisions regarding employee status), decisions by several Swiss governmental bodies ruling that Drivers should be classified as employees for Swiss social security or regulatory purposes, a recent Spanish regulation of food delivery platforms that presumes employment status and a ruling in September 2021 by a Netherlands court that Mobility Drivers are employees within the meaning of the taxi collective bargaining agreement.

In addition, reclassification of Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees where those statuses exist, have and could lead to groups of Drivers becoming represented by labor unions and similar organizations. For example, in May 2021, we formally recognized a UK driver union. If a significant number of Drivers were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were to deviate significantly from our business model, our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.

In addition, a labor dispute involving Drivers may harm our reputation, disrupt our operations and reduce our net revenues, and the resolution of labor disputes may increase our costs.

# Financial Statement Presentation

If we are required to classify Drivers as employees, workers or quasi-employees, this may impact our current financial statement presentation including revenue, cost of revenue, incentives and promotions as further described in our significant and critical accounting policies in the section titled “Critical Accounting Estimates” included in Part I, Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Note 1 in the section titled “Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.

# Competitive Landscape

The mobility, delivery, and logistics industries are highly competitive, with well-established and low-cost alternatives that have been available for decades, low barriers to entry, low switching costs, and well-capitalized competitors in nearly every major geographic region. If we are unable to compete effectively in these industries, our business and financial prospects would be adversely impacted.

Our platform provides offerings in the mobility, delivery, and logistics industries. We compete on a global basis, and the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented. We face significant competition in each of the mobility and delivery industries globally and in the logistics industry in the United States and Canada from existing, well-established, and low-cost alternatives, and in the future we expect to face competition from new market entrants given the low barriers to entry that characterize these industries.

In addition, within each of these markets, the cost to switch between products is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost or highest-quality provider; Drivers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the highest earnings potential; restaurants and other merchants have a propensity to shift to the delivery platform that offers the lowest service fee for their meals and other goods and provides the highest volume of orders; and Shippers and Carriers have a propensity to shift to the platform with the best price and most convenient service for hauling shipments.

Further, while we work to expand globally and introduce new products and offerings across a range of industries, many of our competitors remain focused on a limited number of products or on a narrow geographic scope, allowing them to develop specialized expertise and employ resources in a more targeted manner than we do. As we and our competitors introduce new products and offerings, and as existing products evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may adopt certain of our product features, or may adopt innovations that Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers value more highly than ours, which would render our products less attractive or reduce our ability to differentiate our products. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our services.

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Competition Overview

We face competition in each of our offerings, including:

- Mobility: Competes with personal vehicle ownership, traditional transportation services (taxicabs, livery), public transportation, and other ridesharing companies (e.g., Lyft, Ola, Didi, Grab, Bolt).
- Delivery: Competes with meal and grocery delivery companies (e.g., DoorDash, Deliveroo, Glovo, Instacart, Amazon) and restaurants offering their own delivery services.
- Freight: Competes with freight brokers and managed transportation providers (e.g., C.H. Robinson, XPO Logistics, DHL).

# Competitive Challenges

Many of our competitors are well-capitalized and offer discounted services, which may be more attractive to consumers. They may have greater resources, brand recognition, and marketing budgets, allowing them to respond more effectively to market changes.

We are contractually restricted from competing with certain minority-owned entities in specific regions until certain dates, which may limit our competitive capabilities.

# Regulatory Considerations

Regulatory approval is necessary for acquisitions, and failure to obtain such approval may limit our ability to compete effectively. Remedies required for approval could lead to increased competition.

# Financial Impact of Competition

To remain competitive, we have lowered fares and service fees, and offered Driver incentives and consumer discounts, which have adversely affected our financial performance. In some markets, these incentives may exceed Gross Bookings for a given Trip.

We cannot assure that these strategies will be successful, and they may continue to negatively impact our financial results.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

Our pricing models and strategies have been modified over time and will likely continue to be modified in the future. We cannot assure you that these models will be successful in attracting consumers and Drivers. For instance, changes made in California to the information that Drivers see in the application, along with pricing and offer structure changes, adversely impacted usage of the application.

The markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from various funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. Certain stockholders have made substantial investments in our competitors, which may allow them to compete more effectively against us.

We have incurred significant losses, including operating losses of $3.8 billion and $1.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2022, respectively. As of March 31, 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $31.2 billion. We will need to generate and sustain increased revenue levels and decrease proportionate expenses in future periods to achieve or maintain profitability.

# Financial Performance

|Year|Operating Loss|Accumulated Deficit| | | | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |2021|$3.8 billion|$31.2 billion|
| | | | |2022|$1.8 billion| |

We may continue to incur losses in the near term due to substantial increases in our operating expenses as we invest in various initiatives to increase the number of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers using our platform.

Our success in a given geographic market significantly depends on our ability to develop our network scale and liquidity by attracting Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers to our platform. If we experience Driver supply constraints, we may need to increase Driver incentives, which could adversely affect our financial results.

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

Our number of platform users may decline materially or fluctuate as a result of many factors, including dissatisfaction with the operation of our platform, the price of fares, meals, and shipments, dissatisfaction with the quality of service provided by the Drivers and merchants on our platform, and negative publicity related to our brand.

In addition, if we are unable to provide high-quality support to platform users or respond to reported incidents, including safety incidents, in a timely manner, our ability to attract and retain platform users could be adversely affected. If Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers do not establish or maintain active accounts with us, our revenue would decline, and our business would suffer.

The number of Drivers and merchants on our platform could decline or fluctuate due to various factors, including local laws limiting our products and offerings, low switching costs between competitor platforms, and dissatisfaction with our brand or reputation.

We are investing in our autonomous vehicle strategy, which may add to Driver dissatisfaction over time, as it may reduce the need for Drivers. Continued Driver dissatisfaction may result in a decline in our number of platform users, which would reduce our network liquidity and harm our future operating results.

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our business prospects. We receive significant media coverage, including negative publicity regarding our brand and reputation, and while we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand, failure to maintain or enhance our brand will cause our business to suffer.

# Key Risks

- Decline in platform users due to dissatisfaction with service quality.
- Fluctuations in the number of Drivers and merchants on our platform.
- Increased costs and challenges in Driver qualification and background checks.
- Negative publicity affecting brand reputation.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.

# Brand and Reputation Management

Maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation is critical to our ability to attract new employees and platform users, to preserve and deepen the engagement of our existing employees and platform users, and to mitigate legislative or regulatory scrutiny, litigation, government investigations, and adverse platform user sentiment.

We receive a high degree of negative media coverage around the world, which adversely affects our brand and reputation and fuels distrust of our company. Negative publicity, particularly related to the period prior to and through 2017, adversely affects our brand and reputation, makes it difficult for us to attract and retain platform users, reduces confidence in and use of our products and offerings, invites continued legislative and regulatory scrutiny, and results in additional litigation and governmental investigations.

As a result, our competitors raised additional capital, increased their investments in certain markets, and improved their category positions and market shares, and may continue to do so.

# Safety Reports and Media Coverage

In 2022, we released a second safety report, which provides the public with data related to reports of sexual assaults and other critical safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform in the United States. Public responses to our safety reports or any future safety reports or similar public reporting of safety incidents claimed to have occurred on our platform, which may include disclosure of reports provided to regulators and other government authorities, as well as public responses to any third party assessments of our civil rights impact, may continue to result in positive and negative media coverage and increased regulatory scrutiny and could adversely affect our reputation with platform users.

Further unfavorable media coverage and negative publicity could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects. As our platform continues to scale and becomes increasingly interconnected, resulting in increased media coverage and public awareness of our brand, future damage to our brand and reputation could have an amplified effect on our various platform offerings.

# Impact of Acquired Companies

Additionally, some of our acquired and majority-owned companies, including Careem, Postmates, and Cornershop, have or will continue to use their own brands and/or operate their own apps in parallel with our brand and apps, and any damage or reputational harm to their brands could adversely impact our brand and reputation.

# External Factors Affecting Brand

Our brand and reputation might also be harmed by events outside of our control. For example, we have licensed our brand in connection with certain divestitures and joint ventures, including to Didi in China and to Yandex in Russia/CIS, and while we have certain contractual protections in place governing the use of our brand by these companies, we do not control these businesses, we are not able to anticipate their actions, and consumers may not be aware that these service providers are not controlled by us.

Furthermore, if Drivers, merchants, or Carriers provide diminished quality of service, are involved in incidents regarding safety or privacy, engage in malfeasance, or otherwise violate the law, we may receive unfavorable press coverage and our reputation and business may be harmed.

# Rehabilitation Efforts

While we have taken significant steps to rehabilitate our brand and reputation, the successful rehabilitation of our brand will depend largely on maintaining a good reputation, minimizing the number of safety incidents, continuing an improved culture and workplace practices, improving our compliance programs, maintaining a high quality of service and ethical behavior, and continuing our marketing and public relations efforts.

Our brand promotion, reputation building, and media strategies have involved significant costs and may not be successful. We anticipate that other competitors and potential competitors will expand their offerings, which will make maintaining and enhancing our reputation and brand increasingly more difficult and expensive.

# Workplace Culture and Compliance

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created operational, compliance, and cultural challenges, and a failure to address these challenges would adversely impact our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Our historical workplace culture and forward-leaning approach created significant operational and cultural challenges that have in the past harmed, and may in the future continue to harm, our business results and financial condition. Our prior failure to prioritize compliance has led to increased regulatory scrutiny globally.

# Growth Management Challenges

Since our inception, we have experienced rapid growth in the United States and internationally. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and has placed, and will continue to place, significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources, and internal financial control and reporting functions.

We may not be able to manage our growth effectively, which could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results.

# Employee Growth

As our operations have expanded, we have grown from 159 employees as of December 31, 2012 to approximately 30,700.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

# As of March 31, 2024

As of March 31, 2024, Uber Technologies, Inc. had a total of approximately 17,600 employees located outside the United States. The company continues to expand globally, which has led to an increase in the number of employees outside the U.S. Proper management of this growth necessitates ongoing hiring, training, and management of qualified personnel, including engineers, operations staff, financial and accounting personnel, and sales and marketing teams.

Challenges in hiring, training, and retaining employees could adversely affect the business. The company has implemented workforce reductions and restructurings, which may lead to unintended consequences such as increased attrition, employee distraction, and reduced morale. These factors could harm Uber's reputation as an employer and complicate future hiring efforts.

To support growth, Uber must effectively upgrade its technology and network infrastructure. Failure to do so could result in system disruptions, slow response times, and poor user experiences for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers. Significant resources will be required to enhance transaction processing, operational systems, and internal controls, especially in light of the rapid growth of emerging offerings like Delivery and Freight.

The complexity of Uber's organizational structure is expected to increase as the company adds more Drivers, consumers, merchants, and technologies. Effective management of this growth is crucial to maintaining platform quality and addressing competitive challenges.

Safety incidents involving platform users could negatively impact Uber's ability to attract and retain Drivers and consumers. The company cannot fully control or predict user actions, which may lead to injuries, property damage, or reputational harm. Although Uber conducts background checks on Drivers, these processes may not be comprehensive, and the standards for Couriers are generally less rigorous.

Incidents of misconduct by Drivers or individuals impersonating Drivers could lead to negative press and damage to Uber's brand. The company has faced civil litigation related to inadequate Driver qualification processes and safety misrepresentations.

In summary, Uber Technologies, Inc. must navigate various challenges related to employee management, technology upgrades, organizational complexity, and user safety to ensure continued growth and operational success.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Risks Related to Safety and Liability

Consumers in various regions, particularly in Latin America, have reported increasing incidents of violent crime, including armed robbery, violent assault, and rape, while using our platform. Such incidents could harm our ability to attract users and adversely affect our business and financial results.

Public reporting of safety incidents may also negatively impact our business. We may face significant liability claims related to traffic accidents or other incidents involving drivers, consumers, or third parties, which could increase our operating costs and affect our future prospects.

# Investments in New Offerings and Technologies

We are making substantial investments in new offerings and technologies, including acquisitions like Cornershop for grocery delivery and The Drizly Group for alcohol delivery. However, these ventures are risky, and we may not realize the expected benefits. Our development efforts could distract from current operations and may not lead to commercially successful products.

# International Operations

As of March 31, 2024, approximately 77% of all trips were conducted outside the United States. Operating internationally presents risks that we may not face domestically, including limited experience in various jurisdictions. Our acquisitions, such as Careem and Cornershop, may not yield the expected results and could negatively impact our operations.

# Quarterly Report Overview

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). It provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter, including unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Operational and Compliance Challenges

Uber faces various operational and compliance challenges, including but not limited to:

- Challenges caused by distance, language, and cultural differences.
- Resources required to localize the business, including translation of the mobile app and website.
- Compliance with laws and regulations that may be more restrictive than those in the United States.
- Competition with local companies that have better market understanding.
- Social acceptance of the brand and offerings may vary by region.
- Technological compatibility issues with the platform.
- Exposure to improper business practices in certain cultures.
- Legal uncertainties regarding liability for platform users' actions.
- Difficulties in managing international operations and labor relations.
- Fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
- Challenges in cash-based transaction markets.
- Adverse tax consequences and complexities of foreign tax systems.
- Increased financial accounting and reporting burdens.
- Import/export restrictions and trade regulation changes.
- Political, social, and economic instability in various regions.
- Public health concerns, including pandemics.
- Reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some markets.

These risks could adversely affect our international operations, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

# Minority-Owned Entities

Uber has limited influence over its minority-owned entities, which subjects the company to substantial risks, including potential loss of value. The growth strategy has included:

- Restructuring the business by divesting assets in certain jurisdictions.
- Partnering with and investing in local ridesharing and delivery companies.
- Divesting certain lines of business entirely and investing in competitors.

As a result, a significant portion of Uber's assets includes minority ownership positions in companies such as Didi, Grab, Lime, and Aurora.
# Uber Technologies, Inc. Quarterly Report

# Quarterly Report

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Risks Associated with Ownership in Other Entities

Our ownership in these entities involves significant risks that are outside our control. We are not represented on the management team or board of directors of Didi, and therefore we do not participate in its day-to-day management or the actions taken by the board of directors of Didi. We are not represented on the management teams of Grab, Lime or Aurora, and therefore do not participate in the day-to-day management of Grab, Lime or Aurora. Although we are represented on each of the boards of directors of Grab, Lime and Aurora, we do not have a controlling influence on those boards. As a result, the boards of directors or management teams of these companies may make decisions or take actions with which we disagree or that may be harmful to the value of our ownership in these companies.

Additionally, these companies have expanded their offerings, and we expect them to continue to expand their offerings in the future, to compete with us in various markets throughout the world. While this could enhance the value of our ownership interest in these companies, our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects would be adversely affected by such expansion into markets in which we operate.

# Impact of Market Conditions

Any material decline in the business of these entities would adversely affect the value of our assets and our financial results. Furthermore, the value of these assets is based in part on the market valuations of these entities, and weakened financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect such valuations. To the extent these businesses are or become publicly traded companies, volatility or fluctuations in the stock price of such companies could adversely impact our financial results.

# Operational Risks

These positions could expose us to risks, litigation, and unknown liabilities because, among other things, these companies have limited operating histories in evolving industries and may have less predictable operating results; to the extent these companies are privately owned, limited public information is available and we may not learn all the material information regarding these businesses; are domiciled and operate in countries with particular economic, tax, political, legal, safety, regulatory and public health risks, including the extent of the impact of the pandemic on their business; are domiciled or operate in countries that may become subject to economic sanctions or foreign investment restrictions; depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of individuals, and, as a result, the death, disability, resignation, or termination of one or more of these individuals could have an adverse effect on the relevant company’s operations; and will likely require substantial additional capital to support their operations and expansion and to maintain their competitive positions.

# Limitations on Asset Transfer

Further, we are contractually limited in our ability to sell or transfer these assets. For example, in connection with Aurora’s November 2021 initial public offering, we are subject to a 4-year lock-up with respect to our shares in Aurora. Furthermore, we may be required to sell these assets at a time at which we would not be able to realize what we believe to be the long-term value of these assets. For example, if we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), we may be required to sell some or all of such assets so that we would not be subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act. Additionally, we may have to pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of these assets. Accordingly, we may never realize the value of these assets relative to the contributions we made to these businesses.

# Fluctuations in Operating Results

We may experience significant fluctuations in our operating results. If we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability, our prospects would be adversely affected and investors may lose some or all of the value of their investment. Our operating results may vary significantly and are not necessarily an indication of future performance. These fluctuations may be a result of a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control.

# Seasonal Trends

In addition, we experience seasonal fluctuations in our financial results. For Mobility, we typically generate higher revenue in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due in part to fourth quarter holiday and business demand, and typically generate lower revenue in our first quarter compared to other quarters due in part to less usage of our platform as holiday demand slows down. We have typically experienced lower quarter-over-quarter growth in Mobility trends in the first quarter. For Delivery, we expect to experience seasonal increases in our revenue in the fourth quarter compared to other quarters, although the historical growth of Delivery has masked these seasonal fluctuations.

# Future Growth and Profitability

If our growth slows more significantly than we currently expect, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our financial results and future prospects. We believe that our growth depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:

- Grow supply and demand on our platform;

# Management Discussion and Analysis

The following objectives are critical for our growth and sustainability:

- Increase existing platform users’ activity on our platform;
- Continue to introduce our platform to new markets;
- Provide high-quality support to Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers;
- Expand our business and increase our market share and category position;
- Compete with the products and offerings of, and pricing and incentives offered by, our competitors;
- Develop new products, offerings, and technologies;
- Identify and acquire or invest in businesses, products, offerings, or technologies that we believe could complement or expand our platform;
- Penetrate suburban and rural areas and increase the number of rides taken on our platform outside metropolitan areas;
- Reduce the costs of our Mobility offering to better compete with personal vehicle ownership and usage and other low-cost alternatives like public transportation;
- Maintain existing local regulations in key markets where we operate;
- Enter or expand operations in key countries currently limited by local regulations;
- Increase positive perception of our brand.

We may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. Additionally, the growth of our Delivery offering stemming from stay-at-home order demand related to the pandemic may not continue in the future. A softening of demand from Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers could adversely impact our financial results and future prospects.

In 2023, we derived 20% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from five metropolitan areas: Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Sao Paulo, and London. Our operations in these areas are susceptible to various economic, social, and regulatory conditions. Any adverse changes could significantly affect our business and financial results.

Furthermore, we generated 15% of our Mobility Gross Bookings from trips that either started or were completed at an airport. Our operating results are sensitive to regulations affecting airport-related trips, and sustained declines in air travel could suppress demand for these services.

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Risks Related to Mobility Services

During the height of the pandemic, travel behavior changed and airline travel slowed, reducing the demand for Mobility to and from airports. Certain airports currently regulate ridesharing within airport boundaries, including by mandating that ridesharing service providers obtain airport-specific licenses, and some airports, particularly those outside the United States, have banned ridesharing operations altogether. Despite such bans, some Drivers continue to provide Mobility services, including trips to and from airports, despite lacking the requisite permits. Such actions may result in the imposition of fines or sanctions, including further bans on our ability to operate within airport boundaries, against us or Drivers.

Additional bans on our airport operations, or any permitting requirements or instances of non-compliance by Drivers, would significantly disrupt our operations. In addition, if drop-offs or pick-ups of riders become inconvenient because of airport rules or regulations, or more expensive because of airport-imposed fees, the number of Drivers or consumers could decrease, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

# Autonomous Vehicle Technologies

If we fail to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform or fail to offer such technologies on our platform before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected, are inferior to those offered by our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than those offered by competitors or non-autonomous vehicles, our financial performance and prospects would be adversely impacted.

We have invested, and we may continue to invest, substantial amounts in companies with whom we partner to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform. For example, in January 2021, we completed the merger of our autonomous technologies business with Aurora, and included a $400 million investment in the combined company and a commercial agreement pursuant to which we and Aurora will collaborate with respect to the launch and commercialization of self-driving vehicles on our ridesharing network.

Several companies other than Aurora, including Waymo, Cruise Automation, Tesla, Apple, Zoox (which Amazon has acquired), Aptiv, and Nuro, are developing autonomous vehicle technologies, either alone or through collaborations with car manufacturers, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the mobility, delivery, or logistics industries.

# Regulatory Environment

Federal and state government regulations specifically designed to govern autonomous vehicle operation, testing and/or manufacture are developing. These regulations could include requirements that delay or limit our ability to offer autonomous vehicles on our platform. If regulations of this nature are implemented, we may not be able to offer autonomous vehicle technologies on our platform in the manner we expect, or at all.

# Human Resources Challenges

Our business depends on retaining and attracting high-quality personnel, and continued attrition, future attrition, or unsuccessful succession planning could adversely affect our business. Our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain high-quality management, operations, engineering, and other personnel who are in high demand, are often subject to competing employment offers, and are attractive recruiting targets for our competitors.

Challenges related to our historical culture and workplace practices and negative publicity we experience have in the past led to significant attrition and made it more difficult to attract high-quality employees. Our employees worked from home for almost two years in light of the pandemic, and although we have implemented our “return to office” plan, which includes a shift to a hybrid model where employees have flexibility to work from home, a hybrid model may create challenges, including challenges maintaining our corporate culture, productivity and availability of key personnel and other employees necessary to.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Management Discussion and Analysis

We face challenges related to our culture and workplace practices, which may lead to increased attrition or limit our ability to attract employees. Future leadership transitions and management changes may cause uncertainty in our business, increasing the likelihood of turnover among senior management and other employees.

We depend on the continued services of key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, Dara Khosrowshahi. Our employment agreement with Mr. Khosrowshahi is at-will and has no specific duration. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect our business due to the loss of their skills and industry experience.

# Attracting and Retaining Key Personnel

To attract and retain key personnel, we utilize equity incentives. However, these measures may not be sufficient, especially if the value of our stock does not meet expectations. Our reliance on equity as compensation may not always align with the company’s financial interests.

# Data Security Risks

We have experienced security breaches that could harm our brand and result in significant liabilities. We collect various personal data, making us a target for data security attacks. Any failure to prevent such breaches could lead to loss of revenue and damage to our reputation.

We rely on third-party service providers for data processing, which also poses risks. Security breaches could expose us to liability under various laws and regulations, increasing the risk of litigation and governmental investigation.

# Past Incidents

In September 2022, we experienced a cybersecurity incident where an attacker accessed certain internal systems. Additionally, in 2016, personal data of approximately 57 million Drivers and consumers was downloaded by outside actors. This included sensitive information such as names, email addresses, and drivers’ license numbers.

For further information on these incidents, please refer to the risk factors titled “We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, state Attorney General offices, and other U.S. and foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.”

# Quarterly Report

The provided document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Data Security and Privacy Risks

As we expand our operations, we may also assume liabilities for breaches experienced by the companies we acquire. For example, in April 2018, Careem publicly disclosed a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of riders and drivers on its platform. If Careem becomes subject to liability as a result of this or other data security incidents, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

In July 2020, Drizly publicly disclosed a data security incident that allowed access to certain personal information of customers on its platform. In November 2021, Drizly obtained final court approval of a settlement in a resulting class action litigation. Moreover, in January 2023, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) announced a final order relating to the data security incident. If we fail to remediate this or any other data security incident, we may face harm to our brand, business disruption, and significant liabilities.

# Cybersecurity Threats

Cyberattacks, including computer malware, ransomware, viruses, denial of service attacks, account takeovers, spamming, phishing, and social engineering attacks could harm our reputation, business, and operating results. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations, which contain proprietary or confidential information related to business and personal data.

Cyberthreats are constantly evolving, and our detection capabilities may not be sufficient to prevent or detect sophisticated cyberattacks. Breaches of our facilities, network, applications, or data security could disrupt our business, impair our ability to protect data, and result in significant liabilities.

# System Failures and Security Breaches

Various factors may cause system failures or security breaches, including power outages, catastrophic events, and errors by employees or third-party service providers. If our incident response, disaster recovery, and business continuity plans do not effectively resolve these issues, they could adversely impact our business operations and financial results.

# Product Development and User Retention

To retain and attract Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, we need to invest in the development of new products, offerings, and features that add value and differentiate us from competitors. For example, in January 2020, we introduced product changes in California to provide Drivers with more information about rider destinations and expected fares.

Developing and delivering new or upgraded products is costly, and the success of such new products is not guaranteed.

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Operational Metrics and Challenges

We track certain operational metrics and our category position with internal systems and tools, and our equity stakes in minority-owned entities with information provided by such minority-owned entities, and do not independently verify such metrics. Certain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.

Key metrics include MAPCs, Trips, Gross Bookings, and our category position. These metrics are tracked with internal systems and tools that may differ from estimates published by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or assumptions. If our internal systems undercount or overcount performance, the data we report may not be accurate.

# Cash Payment Concerns

In certain jurisdictions, we allow consumers to pay for rides and meal or grocery deliveries using cash, which raises numerous regulatory, operational, and safety concerns. In 2023, cash-paid trips accounted for approximately 6% of our global Gross Bookings. This percentage may increase, particularly in markets where Careem operates.

Regulatory concerns include specific regulations regarding cash use for ridesharing, which could result in significant fines or operational suspensions. Additionally, cash transactions can increase safety risks for Drivers and riders, including potential robbery and violent attacks.

Establishing the proper infrastructure to ensure correct service fee collection on cash trips is complex. We have created systems for Drivers to collect and deposit cash, but these systems may not always be effective. Operating a cash-based business raises compliance risks with various regulations, including anti-money laundering laws.

# Conclusion

If we are unable to manage these challenges effectively, it could result in reputational harm and adversely impact our financial performance.

# Risks Related to Credit Card Acceptance

Loss or material modification of our credit card acceptance privileges could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results. In 2023, 69% of our Gross Bookings were paid by either credit card or debit card. As such, the loss of our credit card acceptance privileges would significantly limit our business model.

We are required by our payment processors to comply with payment card network operating rules, including the Payment Card Industry (PCI) and Data Security Standard (the Standard). The Standard is a comprehensive set of requirements for enhancing payment account data security developed by the PCI Security Standards Council to help facilitate the broad adoption of consistent data security measures.

Our failure to comply with the Standard and other network operating rules could result in fines or restrictions on our ability to accept payment cards. Under certain circumstances specified in the payment card network rules, we may be required to submit to periodic audits, self-assessments, or other assessments of our compliance with the Standard. Such activities may reveal that we have failed to comply with the Standard.

If an audit, self-assessment, or other test determines that we need to take steps to remediate any deficiencies, such remediation efforts may distract our management team and require us to undertake costly and time-consuming remediation efforts. In addition, even if we comply with the Standard, there is no assurance that we will be protected from a security breach.

Moreover, the payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret existing rules that we or our processors might find difficult or even impossible to follow, or costly to implement. In addition to violations of network rules, including the Standard, any failure to maintain good relationships with the payment card networks could impact our ability to receive incentives from them, could increase our costs, or could otherwise harm our business.

The loss of our credit card acceptance privileges for any one of these reasons, or the significant modification of the terms under which we obtain credit card acceptance privileges, may have an adverse effect on our business, revenue, and operating results.

# Technical Risks of Our Platform

Our platform is highly technical, and any undetected errors could adversely affect our business. Our platform is a complex system composed of many interoperating components and incorporates software that is highly complex. Our business is dependent upon our ability to prevent system interruption on our platform.

Our software, including open source software that is incorporated into our code, may now or in the future contain undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software code may only be discovered after the code has been released. Bugs in our software, third-party software including open source software that is incorporated into our code, misconfigurations of our systems, and unintended interactions between systems could result in our failure to comply with certain federal, state, or foreign reporting obligations, or could cause downtime that would impact the availability of our service to platform users.

We have from time to time found defects or errors in our system and may discover additional defects in the future that could result in platform unavailability or system disruption. In addition, we have experienced outages on our platform due to circumstances within our control, such as outages due to software limitations.

We rely on co-located data centers for the operation of our platform. If our co-located data centers fail, our platform users may experience downtime. If sustained or repeated, any of these outages could reduce the attractiveness of our platform to platform users.

In addition, our release of new software in the past has inadvertently caused, and may in the future cause, interruptions in the availability or functionality of our platform. Any errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or systems after release could result in an interruption in the availability of our platform or a negative experience for Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers, and could also result in negative publicity and unfavorable media coverage, damage to our reputation, loss of platform users, loss of revenue or liability for damages, regulatory inquiries, or other proceedings, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.

# Risks Associated with Artificial Intelligence

Our growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) (including machine learning) in our business and offerings presents additional risks. This technology presents a number of risks inherent in its use. AI algorithms or automated processing of data may be flawed and datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information, which can create inaccurate or discriminatory outcomes.

AI tools and algorithms may use third-party AI with unclear intellectual property rights or interests. Intellectual property ownership and license rights, including copyright, of generative and other AI output, have not been fully interpreted by courts or regulations.

Europe, the United States and other countries are enacting or may consider comprehensive legal compliance frameworks specifically for AI, which is a trend that may increase now that European lawmakers have passed the first such framework, expected to come into effect in 2024.

Further, more specific AI-related laws and regulations have been enacted, and are expected to continue to be enacted, around the world. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such requirements could have an adverse impact on our business.

AI use or management by us or others, including certain decisions based (whether partially or solely) on automated processing or profiling, inappropriate or controversial data practices, or insufficient disclosures regarding machine learning and algorithms or AI-generated content, have and could impair the acceptance of AI solutions or subject us to lawsuits, regulatory investigations or other harm, such as negative impacts to the value of our intellectual property or our brand.

These and other deficiencies could also undermine the decisions, predictions or analysis AI applications produce, or lead to unintentional bias and discrimination, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. The rapid evolution of AI may require us to allocate additional resources to help implement AI ethically in order to minimize unintended or...

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Climate Change Risks

We face climate change related physical and transition risks, which include risks associated with market shifts toward more sustainable or renewable forms of energy and energy conservation. In the context of our business, this includes market shifts toward electric vehicles (“EVs”) and lower carbon business models, and potential increased energy costs.

# Physical Climate Change Risks

Physical climate change risks include risks related to extreme weather events or natural disasters, such as extreme storms, flooding, droughts, wildfires, and sea-level rise. These events have the potential to disrupt our business and may cause us to experience higher losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations.

# Regulatory Environment

We are subject to emerging environmental and social laws and regulations, including climate policies such as regulations adopted in California requiring 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets to be in zero emission vehicles by 2030. Additionally, we are subject to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive in the European Union, with targets beginning in 2024.

# Environmental and Social Commitments

We have made certain climate-related commitments, including:

- 100% renewable electricity for our U.S. offices by 2025
- Net zero climate emissions from corporate operations by 2030
- Net zero company by 2040
- Reduction of unnecessary packaging waste from deliveries by 2030

# Challenges and Uncertainties

Progressing towards our climate commitments requires significant effort and resources. There can be no assurances that our commitments will be achieved as intended, and any failure to meet regulatory requirements or stated commitments could adversely impact our costs and ability to operate.

# Conclusion

All our environmental, social, and governance disclosures, including our climate goals, are subject to certain assumptions and methodologies that may be determined to be erroneous or misaligned with stakeholder expectations.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Risk Factors

# Stakeholder Expectations

Perceived failure to satisfy evolving stakeholder expectations for environmental, social and governance practices and reporting may harm our reputation and impact relationships with certain investors and other stakeholders. Furthermore, there are efforts by some stakeholders to reduce or limit companies’ efforts on certain environmental, social and governance related matters. Both advocates and opponents are increasingly resorting to a range of activism forms, including media campaigns and litigation, to advance their perspectives. To the extent we are subject to such activism, and we have been in the past, it may require us to incur costs or otherwise adversely impact our business. This and other stakeholder expectations will likely lead to increased compliance costs as well as scrutiny that could heighten all of the risks identified above and other similar risks.

# General Economic Risks

Occurrence of a catastrophic event, including but not limited to disease, a weather event, war, or terrorist attack, could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operation. Outbreaks of contagious disease and the impact of actions to mitigate such disease or pandemic, have adversely impacted and could in the future adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks related to health epidemics, outbreaks of contagious disease, and other adverse health developments. For example, the pandemic and responses thereto had an adverse impact on our business and operations, including, for example, by reducing the demand for our Mobility offerings globally, and affecting travel behavior and demand, as well as impacting Driver supply constraints. As another example, during the pandemic, to support social distancing, we temporarily suspended our shared rides offering globally.

We cannot predict the impact a catastrophic event, including disease, weather event, war or terrorist attack will have on our business, end-users’ behaviors, business partners and third-party vendors, and we may be adversely impacted as a result of the adverse impact our business partners and third-party vendors suffer. For example, concerns over the economic impact of the pandemic caused extreme volatility in financial markets, which adversely impacted our stock price and our ability to access capital markets, and any future pandemics or other catastrophic events may have a similar impact. In addition, the broader consequences of conflicts in the Middle East and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which may include additional international sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts, increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate, and the extent of the conflict’s effect on the global economy, cannot be predicted. Any of these risks could materially affect our business or the value of our assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or the trading price of our common stock.

The failure of a bank, or other adverse conditions impacting financial institutions at which we maintain balances, could adversely impact our liquidity and financial performance. There can be no assurance that our deposits in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits will be backstopped by the U.S., or that any bank or financial institution with which we do business will be able to obtain needed liquidity from other banks, government institutions or by acquisition in the event of a failure or liquidity crisis. To the extent any of the foregoing or other catastrophic event adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section. Any of the foregoing factors, or other cascading effects that are not foreseeable, could adversely impact our business, financial performance and condition, and results of operations.

# Economic Conditions

The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on discretionary consumer spending, may harm our business and operating results. Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of discretionary consumer spending. Some of the factors that have an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. A deterioration of general macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, inflation and higher interest rates, or decreases in consumer spending power may harm our results of operations.

For example, inflation has increased and is expected to increase our insurance costs. Consumer preferences tend to shift to lower-cost alternatives during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected. In such circumstances, consumers may choose to use one of our lower price-point products over a higher Gross Bookings per Trip offering, may choose to forgo our offerings for lower-cost personal vehicle or public transportation alternatives, or may reduce total miles traveled as economic activity decreases. Such a shift in consumer behavior may reduce our network liquidity and may harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

Likewise, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, including many of the merchants in our network, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. Further, because spending for food purchases from merchants is generally considered discretionary, any decline in consumer spending may have a disproportionate effect on our Delivery offering. If spending at many of the merchants in our network declines, or if a significant number of these merchants go out of business, consumers may be less likely to use our products and offerings, which could harm our business and operating results. Alternatively, if economic conditions improve, it could lead to Drivers obtaining additional or alternative opportunities for work, which could negatively impact the number of Drivers on our platform, and thereby reduce our network liquidity.

Increases in fuel, food, labor, energy, and other costs due to inflation and other factors could adversely affect our operating results.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Factors Affecting Costs

Factors such as inflation, increased fuel prices, and increased vehicle purchase, rental, insurance, or maintenance costs, including increased prices of new and used vehicle parts as a result of recent global supply chain challenges, and increased fuel prices as a result of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, have and may continue to increase the costs incurred by Drivers and Carriers when providing services on our platform.

Similarly, factors such as inflation, increased food costs, increased labor and employee benefit costs, increased rental costs, and increased energy costs may increase merchant operating costs, particularly in certain international markets, such as Egypt. Many of the factors affecting Driver, merchant, and Carrier costs are beyond the control of these parties.

In many cases, these increased costs may cause Drivers and Carriers to spend less time providing services on our platform or to seek alternative sources of income. Likewise, these increased costs may cause merchants to pass costs on to consumers by increasing prices, which would likely cause order volume to decline, may cause merchants to cease operations altogether, or may cause Carriers to pass costs on to Shippers, which may cause shipments on our platform to decline. A decreased supply of Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, or Carriers on our platform would decrease our network liquidity, which could harm our business and operating results.

# Dependencies on Third Parties

The successful operation of our business depends upon the performance and reliability of Internet, mobile, and other infrastructures that are not under our control. Disruptions in Internet infrastructure or GPS signals or the failure of telecommunications network operators to provide us with the bandwidth we need to provide our products and offerings have interfered, and could continue to interfere with the speed and availability of our platform.

If our platform is unavailable when platform users attempt to access it, or if our platform does not load as quickly as platform users expect, platform users may not return to our platform as often in the future, or at all, and may use our competitors’ products or offerings more often. In addition, we have no control over the costs of the services provided by national telecommunications operators. If mobile Internet access fees or other charges to Internet users increase, consumer traffic may decrease, which may in turn cause our revenue to significantly decrease.

Our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of mobile communications systems. The occurrence of an unanticipated problem, such as a power outage, telecommunications delay or failure, security breach, or computer virus could result in delays or interruptions to our products, offerings, and platform, as well as business interruptions for us and platform users.

Furthermore, foreign governments may leverage their ability to shut down directed services, and local governments may shut down our platform at the routing level. Any of these events could damage our reputation, significantly disrupt our operations, and subject us to liability, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

We have invested significant resources to develop new products to mitigate the impact of potential interruptions to mobile communications systems, which can be used by consumers in territories where mobile communications systems are less efficient. However, these products may ultimately be unsuccessful.

# Reliance on Third Parties

We rely on third parties maintaining open marketplaces to distribute our platform and to provide the software we use in certain of our products and offerings. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our products or offerings or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

Our platform relies on third parties maintaining open marketplaces, including the Apple App Store and Google Play, which make applications available for download. We cannot assure you that the marketplaces through which we distribute our platform will maintain their current structures or that such marketplaces will not charge us fees to list our applications for download.

For example, Apple Inc. requires that iOS apps obtain users’ permission to track their activities across third-party apps and websites. If iOS users do not grant us such permission, our ability to target those users for advertisements and to measure the effectiveness of such advertisements may be adversely affected, which could decrease the effectiveness of our advertising, and increase our costs to acquire and engage users on our platform.

We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our products and offerings, including Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform. We do not believe that an alternative mapping solution exists that can provide the global functionality that we require to offer our platform in all of the markets in which we operate.

We do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Drivers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. If such third parties cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Drivers use, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.

# Interoperability of Our Platform

Our business depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems, and third-party applications that we do not control. One of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running various operating systems such as iOS.

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Risks Related to Third-Party Services

We depend on the accessibility of our platform across third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control. Moreover, third-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure its compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. The loss of interoperability, whether due to actions of third parties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business.

We rely on third parties for elements of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform. If these third-party elements become unavailable or unavailable on favorable terms, our business could be adversely affected.

The convenient payment mechanisms provided by our platform are key factors contributing to the development of our business. We rely on third parties for elements of our payment-processing infrastructure to remit payments to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers using our platform, and these third parties may refuse to renew our agreements with them on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us on acceptable terms or at all, our business may be disrupted.

For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we generally pay interchange fees and other processing and gateway fees, and such fees result in significant costs. In addition, online payment providers are under continued pressure to pay increased fees to banks to process funds, and there is no assurance that such online payment providers will not pass any increased costs on to merchant partners, including us. If these fees increase over time, our operating costs will increase, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, system failures have at times prevented us from making payments to Drivers in accordance with our typical timelines and processes, and have caused substantial Driver dissatisfaction and generated a significant number of Driver complaints. Future failures of the payment processing infrastructure underlying our platform could cause Drivers to lose trust in our payment operations and could cause them to instead use our competitors’ platforms.

If the quality or convenience of our payment processing infrastructure declines as a result of these limitations or for any other reason, the attractiveness of our business to Drivers, merchants, and Carriers could be adversely affected. If we are forced to migrate to other third-party payment service providers for any reason, the transition would require significant time and management resources, and may not be as effective, efficient, or well-received by platform users.

# Reliance on Third-Party Service Providers

We currently rely on a small number of third-party service providers to host a significant portion of our platform, and any interruptions or delays in services from these third parties could impair the delivery of our products and offerings and harm our business.

We use a combination of third-party cloud computing services and co-located data centers in the United States and abroad. We do not control the physical operation of any of the co-located data centers we use or the operations of our third-party service providers. These third-party operations and co-located data centers may experience break-ins, computer viruses, denial-of-service attacks, sabotage, acts of vandalism, and other misconduct.

These facilities may also be vulnerable to damage or interruption from power loss, telecommunications failures, fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and similar events. Our systems do not provide complete redundancy of data storage or processing, and as a result, the occurrence of any such event, a decision by our third-party service providers to close our co-located data centers without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems may result in our inability to serve data reliably or require us to migrate our data to either a new on-premise data center or cloud computing service.

This could be time-consuming and costly and may result in the loss of data, any of which could significantly interrupt the provision of our products and offerings and harm our reputation and brand. We may not be able to easily switch to another cloud or data center provider in the event of any disruptions or interference to the services we use, and even if we do, other cloud and data center providers are subject to the same risks.

Additionally, our co-located data center facility agreements are of limited durations, and our co-located data center facilities have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to renew our agreements with these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, we may experience delays in the provision of our products and offerings until an agreement with another co-located data center is arranged.

Interruptions in the delivery of our products and offerings may reduce our revenue, cause Drivers, merchants, and Carriers to stop offering their services through our platform, and reduce use of our platform by consumers and Shippers. Our business and operating results may be harmed if current and potential Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, and Carriers believe our platform is unreliable.

In addition, if we are unable to scale our data storage and computational capacity sufficiently or on commercially reasonable terms, our ability to innovate and introduce new products on our platform may be delayed or compromised, which would have an adverse effect on our growth and business.

# Use of Third-Party Open Source Software

We use third-party open source software in connection with the development of our platform. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open source software and their compliance with the terms of the applicable open source license.

We may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software, or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source licenses require end-users who distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to make available all or part of such software, which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code.

# Compliance and Risks

While we employ practices designed to monitor our compliance with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we have not run a complete open source license review and may inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the applicable terms of such license, including claims for infringement of intellectual property rights or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there is an increasing number of open-source software license types, almost none of which have been tested in a court of law, resulting in a dearth of guidance regarding the proper legal interpretation of such licenses. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of our open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code or expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software.

In addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software because open-source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on the functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks because the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to determine how to compromise our platform. Additionally, because any software source code that we make available under an open source license or that we contribute to existing open source projects becomes publicly available, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights in such software source code may be limited or lost entirely, and we would be unable to prevent our competitors or others from using such contributed software source code. Any of the foregoing could be harmful to our business, financial condition, or operating results and could help our competitors develop products and offerings that are similar to or better than ours.

# Financing and Transactional Risks

We will require additional capital to support the growth of our business, and this capital might not be available on reasonable terms or at all. To continue to effectively compete, we will require additional funds to support the growth of our business and allow us to invest in new products, offerings, and markets. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders may suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue may have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of existing stockholders. Certain of our existing debt instruments contain, and any debt financing we secure in the future could contain, restrictive covenants relating to our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other financial and operational matters that make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital with which to pursue business opportunities. For example, our existing debt instruments contain significant restrictions on our ability to incur additional secured indebtedness. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when required, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges and competition may be significantly limited.

We have incurred a significant amount of debt and may in the future incur additional indebtedness. Our payment obligations under such indebtedness may limit the funds available to us, and the terms of our debt agreements may restrict our flexibility in operating our business. As of March 31, 2024, we had total outstanding indebtedness of $9.6 billion aggregate principal amount. In addition, up to approximately $128 million of Careem Convertible Notes remain subject to future issuance to Careem stockholders as of March 31, 2024. Subject to the limitations in the terms of our existing and future indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may incur additional debt, secure existing or future debt, or refinance our debt. In particular, we may need to incur additional debt to finance the purchase of autonomous vehicles, and such financing may not be available to us on attractive terms or at all.

We may be required to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness. Such payments will reduce the funds available to us for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes and limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, expansion plans, and other investments, which may in turn limit our ability to implement our business strategy, heighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, the industry, or in the general economy, limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry, and prevent us from taking advantage of business opportunities as they arise. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future financing will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to make required and timely payments on our indebtedness, or to fund our operations. To date, we have used a substantial amount of cash for operating activities, and we cannot assure you when we will begin to generate cash from operating activities in amounts sufficient to cover our debt service obligations.

In addition, under certain of our existing debt instruments, we and certain of our subsidiaries are subject to limitations regarding our business and operations, including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and liens, limitations on certain consolidations, mergers, and sales of assets, and restrictions on the payment of dividends or distributions. Any debt financing secured by us in the future could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital-raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions or divestitures. Any default under our debt arrangements could require that we repay our loans.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

# Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate risk related to some of our indebtedness, which may limit our ability to obtain additional financing, adversely affecting our cash flows and liquidity.

# Tax Liabilities

We may have exposure to materially greater than anticipated tax liabilities due to the uncertainty of tax laws applicable to our global business activities. We are subject to tax in multiple jurisdictions and have structured our operations to reduce our effective tax rate. Investigations into our compliance with tax rules in certain jurisdictions could lead to additional taxes owed.

# Pay-to-Play Tax Payments

In certain jurisdictions, we are required to pay assessed taxes prior to contesting them, which could adversely impact our liquidity. Such payments do not imply admission of tax liability, and we continue to defend our positions vigorously.

# Tax Audits and Methodologies

Tax authorities may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology, potentially increasing our effective tax rate. Regular reviews and audits by tax authorities could adversely affect our financial position and operating results.

# Future Tax Liabilities

Our future income taxes may be affected by various factors, including earnings fluctuations in different jurisdictions, changes in tax laws, and the outcomes of ongoing audits. We cannot predict whether we may incur material additional tax liabilities in the future.

# Impact of Global and U.S. Tax Legislation

Changes in global and U.S. tax legislation may adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We are unable to predict future tax reforms and their potential effects on our business. New digital services taxes could also increase our tax obligations.

As a result of the expanding scale of our international business activities, changes in taxation could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, operating results, and cash flows.

# Quarterly Report

The provided document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Tax Attributes and Limitations

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of December 31, 2023, we had:

- U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $296 million that begin to expire in 2031 and $12.2 billion that have an unlimited carryover period.
- U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $8.8 billion that started expiring in 2023 and $1.9 billion that have an unlimited carryover period.
- Foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $872 million that started expiring in 2024 and $18.6 billion that have an unlimited carryover period.

Realization of these net operating loss carryforwards depends on our future taxable income, and there is a risk that our existing carryforwards could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results.

# Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations

We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Because we conduct a significant and may conduct a growing portion of our business in currencies other than the U.S. dollar but report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. As exchange rates vary, revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and assets and liabilities may also vary materially and thus affect our overall financial results.

# Acquisition and Integration Risks

If we are unable to successfully identify, acquire and integrate suitable businesses, our operating results and prospects could be harmed. We have entered into, and expect to continue to enter into, agreements to acquire companies, form joint ventures, and divest portions of our business. Competition for acquisitions is intense, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on commercially reasonable terms.

Further, negotiations for potential acquisitions may divert our management’s time and incur significant costs. We may finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, which may result in dilution to our stockholders. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, our business and financial condition may be harmed.

# Integration Challenges

Any businesses we acquire may not perform as expected. The process of integrating an acquired company is subject to various risks and challenges, including:

- Diverting management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration.
- Disrupting our ongoing business operations.
- Platform user acceptance of the acquired company’s offerings.
- Implementing or remediating the controls, procedures, and policies of the acquired company.
- Integrating the acquired business onto our systems and ensuring compliance with financial reporting.

# Quarterly Report

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Integration Challenges

We face several challenges when integrating acquired companies, including:

- Retaining and integrating acquired employees, aligning incentives, and managing cultural differences.
- Maintaining important business relationships and contracts of the acquired business.
- Integrating brand identities and operations of acquired companies.
- Liability for pre-acquisition activities and potential litigation.
- Impairment charges associated with goodwill and other intangible assets.

Our acquisition of Careem has increased our risks under the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar laws. Existing safeguards may not be effective, and we could be held responsible for corrupt practices by acquired parties.

# Share Repurchase Program

Our board has authorized a share repurchase program, but it does not obligate us to repurchase a specific amount or number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases are at management's discretion, and we cannot guarantee that the program will enhance long-term stockholder value.

# Legal and Regulatory Risks

We may face restrictions in providing our services in certain jurisdictions, requiring modifications to our business model. For example:

- In markets like Argentina, Germany, and Spain, our ridesharing model has faced regulatory challenges.
- We have had to suspend services in places like Barcelona due to new regulations.
- Traditional taxi operators continue to lobby for regulations that could impact our operations.

These factors may adversely affect our ability to operate, our financial condition, and our operating results.

It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Regulatory Impact on Financial Performance

Uber's financial performance in various jurisdictions, including New York City, has been impacted by regulatory measures. In August 2018, the New York City Council approved regulations affecting driver earnings, licensing, and a freeze on new for-hire vehicle licenses, which remains in effect. Similarly, a surcharge on ridesharing trips was implemented in San Francisco in January 2020, and a new tax was introduced in Chicago.

In March 2022, Washington state established a minimum pay standard for drivers, and other jurisdictions are considering similar regulations. These developments could adversely affect Uber's business growth and financial performance.

# Legal and Regulatory Risks

Uber operates under various national, state, local, and municipal laws that may be ambiguous or conflicting. For instance, a ruling in Hong Kong against drivers using the Uber app could hinder operations there. In Colombia, Uber temporarily ceased operations due to a court ruling but later re-launched after appealing the decision.

Continuing operations in jurisdictions with unclear regulations may lead to fines or penalties, potentially affecting driver participation and revenue. Uber has incurred significant costs defending its business model and may face additional regulatory obstacles from competitors and local governments.

# Future Regulatory Challenges

As of December 31, 2023, Uber's platform is available in over 10,000 cities across approximately 70 countries, facing diverse and sometimes conflicting regulations. Proposed laws could materially harm Uber's business by increasing operating costs and limiting user growth.

New laws, especially in areas like non-emergency medical transportation, could expose Uber to substantial liabilities. The company is actively challenging restrictive regulations and lobbying against similar proposals in other jurisdictions.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Regulatory and Legal Risks

Restrictions on our business, especially our ridesharing services, may impact our operations. A significant portion of our business involves vehicles that run on fossil fuels, and laws aimed at curbing air pollution or emissions could affect us. For instance, in response to London's emission reduction efforts, we have implemented a clean-air fee of 15 pence per mile for trips in London and aim to assist drivers in transitioning to electric vehicles by 2025.

In California, a regulation mandates that 90% of vehicle miles traveled by rideshare fleets must be in electric vehicles by 2030, with interim targets starting in 2023. Additionally, proposed regulations in Egypt may require us to share personal data with government authorities, which could lead to significant fines or app shutdowns if we fail to comply.

# Litigation

We are currently involved in various litigations across jurisdictions. Some legal challenges are initiated by us to contest certain laws, while others are brought against us by taxicab owners, regulators, and users. These lawsuits cover a range of issues, including transportation, competition, advertising, consumer protection, and employment. For example, a class action was filed in Australia regarding our operations in specific regions, which was settled without admission of liability.

# Competition Laws

Our business is subject to scrutiny under U.S. and foreign antitrust laws. Governments are increasingly enforcing competition laws, particularly in large markets like the EU and the U.S. Complaints have been filed alleging violations of antitrust laws, and new requirements or restrictions could lead to adverse publicity or fines.

Government agencies may impose restrictions on our operations, which could increase our costs or reduce demand for our platform. We anticipate continued scrutiny of merger activities, especially in the technology sector, and changes in antitrust laws may limit our future growth and operations.

# Conclusion

Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight, particularly concerning payment and financial services. The evolving regulatory landscape poses ongoing challenges that could impact our financial condition and operational results.

# Quarterly Report

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Regulatory Compliance and Payment Services

Most jurisdictions in which we operate have laws that govern payment and financial services activities. Regulators in certain jurisdictions may determine that certain aspects of our business are subject to these laws and could require us to obtain licenses to continue to operate in such jurisdictions.

For example, our subsidiary in the Netherlands, Uber Payments B.V., is registered and authorized by its competent authority, De Nederlandsche Bank, as an electronic money institution. This authorization permits Uber Payments B.V. to provide payment services (including acquiring and executing payment transactions and money remittances, as referred to in the Revised Payment Services Directive (2015/2366/EU)) and to issue electronic money in the Netherlands.

In addition, Uber Payments B.V. has notified De Nederlandsche Bank that it will provide such services on a cross-border passport basis into other countries within the EEA. Uber Payments UK Limited holds a similar license in the United Kingdom issued by the Financial Conduct Authority, as does UBR Pagos México, S.A. de C.V., Institución de Fondos de Pago Electrónico, issued by the Comisión Nacional Bancaria y de Valores in Mexico.

We continue to critically evaluate our options for seeking additional licenses and approvals in several other jurisdictions to optimize our payment solutions and support the future growth of our business. We could be denied such licenses, have existing licenses revoked, or be required to make significant changes to our business operations before being granted such licenses.

If we are denied payment or other financial licenses or such licenses are revoked, we could be forced to cease or limit business operations in certain jurisdictions, including in the EEA, and even if we are able to obtain such licenses, we could be subject to fines or other enforcement action, or stripped of such licenses, if we are found to violate the requirements of such licenses.

# Impact of Strong Customer Authentication

Starting in December 2020, payments made by platform users with payment accounts in the EEA for services provided through our platform may be subject to Strong Customer Authentication (“SCA”) regulatory requirements. In many cases, SCA will require a platform user to engage in additional steps to authenticate each payment transaction.

These additional authentication requirements in EEA or similar requirements, such as tokenization, in other countries may make our platform user experience substantially less convenient, and such loss of convenience could meaningfully reduce the frequency with which platform users use our platform or could cause some platform users to stop using our platform entirely, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

Further, as a result of implementing SCA, many payment transactions on our platform may fail to be authenticated due to platform users not completing all necessary authentication steps. Thus, in some cases, we may not receive payment from consumers in advance of paying Drivers for services received by those users.

A substantial increase in the frequency with which we make Driver payments without having received corresponding payments from consumers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Regulatory Changes and Compliance Risks

In addition, laws related to money transmission and online payments are evolving, and changes in such laws could affect our ability to provide payment processing on our platform in the same form and on the same terms as we have historically, or at all.

For example, changes to our business in Europe, combined with changes to the EU Payment Services Directive, caused aspects of our payment operations in the EEA to fall within the scope of European payments regulation. As a result, one of our subsidiaries, Uber Payments B.V., is directly subject to financial services regulations (including those relating to anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, and sanctioned or prohibited persons) in the Netherlands and in other countries in the EEA where it conducts business.

Effective July 1, 2020, we transitioned all our payment operations to the Uber Payments B.V. regulated entity in the EEA countries in which we are required to do so by the European payments regulations.

As we evolve our business or make changes to our business structure, we may be subject to additional laws or requirements related to money transmission, online payments, and financial regulation. These laws govern, among other things, money transmission, prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfers, anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing, banking, systemic integrity risk assessments, security of payment processes, and import and export restrictions.

Our business operations, including our payments to Drivers and merchants, may not always comply with these financial laws and regulations. Historical or future non-compliance with these laws or regulations could result in significant criminal and civil lawsuits, penalties, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions.

Costs associated with fines and enforcement actions, as well as reputational harm, changes in compliance requirements, or limits on our ability to expand our product offerings, could harm our business.

# Fraud and Security Risks

Further, our payment system is susceptible to illegal and improper uses, including fraud on our platform such as fraud against us or platform users, money laundering, terrorist financing, fraudulent sales of goods or services, and payments to sanctioned parties.

We have invested and will need to continue to invest substantial resources to comply with applicable anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, and in the EEA to conduct appropriate risk assessments and implement appropriate controls as a regulated financial service provider.

Government authorities may seek to bring legal action against us if our payment system is used for improper or illegal purposes or if our enterprise risk management or controls in the EEA are not adequately assessed, updated, or implemented, and any such action could result in financial or reputational harm to our business.

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Regulatory Inquiries and Investigations

We currently are subject to a number of inquiries, investigations, and requests for information from the DOJ, other federal, state and local government agencies and other foreign government agencies, the adverse outcomes of which could harm our business.

We are the subject of DOJ inquiries and investigations, as well as enforcement inquiries and investigations by other federal, state and local government agencies and other regulators abroad. Those inquiries and investigations cover a broad range of matters, including but not limited to:

- Business practices, such as fees, driver and courier earnings, consumer pricing, earner benefits, and related disclosures.
- Policies and practices related to use of our platform by consumers with disabilities.
- Relationships with third parties.
- Data privacy practices and data privacy and security incidents.

These issues may continue to lead to costly and time-consuming regulatory investigations and litigation from other government entities, as well as potentially material fines and penalties imposed by other U.S. and international regulators. Investigations and enforcement actions from such entities, as well as continued negative publicity and an erosion of current and prospective platform users’ trust, could severely disrupt our business.

# Data Privacy and Security Risks

We face risks related to our collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing of data, which could result in investigations, inquiries, litigation, fines, legislative and regulatory action, and negative press about our privacy and data protection practices.

The nature of our business exposes us to claims, including civil lawsuits in the United States such as those related to the 2016 Breach. These and any past or future privacy or security incidents could result in violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, data protection, and other laws. Such violations subject us to individual or consumer class action litigation as well as governmental investigations and proceedings by federal, state, and local regulatory entities in the United States and internationally, resulting in exposure to material civil or criminal liability.

# Recent Developments

In April 2018, we entered into an FTC consent decree pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, to implement a comprehensive privacy program, undergo biennial third-party assessments, and not misrepresent how we protect consumer information through 2038. In October 2018, the FTC approved the final settlement, which exposes us to penalties for, amongst other activities, future failure to report security incidents.

In November and December 2018, UK, Dutch and French supervisory authorities imposed fines totaling approximately $1.6 million. We have also entered into settlement agreements with numerous state enforcement agencies. For example, in January 2016, we entered into a settlement with the Office of the New York State Attorney General under which we agreed to enhance our data security practices.

# Liabilities and Third-Party Risks

Our insurance programs may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for the full extent of our potential liabilities. We may also be impacted by privacy or security incidents at third-party service providers. We rely on third-party service providers to host or otherwise process some of our data and that of platform users, and they have experienced, and may again experience, security and privacy incidents.

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Data Privacy and Security Risks

Security breaches or improper access to, or use, acquisition, disclosure, alteration, or destruction of, such data could have similar adverse consequences for us. This risk is enhanced in certain jurisdictions with stringent privacy laws and, as we expand our products, offerings, and operations domestically and internationally, we have, and may continue to become subject to amended or additional laws that impose substantial additional obligations related to data privacy and security.

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

The EU adopted the GDPR in 2016, and it became effective in May 2018. The GDPR applies extraterritorially and imposes stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data. Such requirements include:

- Higher consent standards to process personal data
- Robust disclosures regarding the use of personal data
- Strengthened individual data rights
- Data breach requirements
- Limitations on data retention
- Strengthened requirements for special categories of personal data and pseudonymised data
- Additional obligations for contracting with service providers that may process personal data

Non-compliance with the GDPR is subject to significant penalties, including fines of up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue, and injunctions against the processing of personal data.

# California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

The CCPA, which provided new privacy rights for consumers and new operational requirements for businesses, went into effect in January 2020. The CCPA includes a statutory damages framework and private rights of action against businesses that fail to comply with certain CCPA terms or implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches.

# International Data Protection Laws

Other jurisdictions outside the EU are similarly introducing or enhancing privacy and data security laws, rules, and regulations, including for automated processing, decision making, and profiling, which will increase our compliance costs and the risks associated with non-compliance. Brazil's General Data Protection Law (LGPD) is an example of such legislation.

# Cross-Border Data Transfers

We are subject to laws, rules, and regulations regarding cross-border transfers of personal data, including laws relating to the transfer of personal data outside the EEA. We rely on transfer mechanisms permitted under these laws, which have received heightened regulatory and judicial scrutiny.

# Potential Consequences of Non-Compliance

If we cannot rely on existing mechanisms for transferring personal data from the EEA, the United Kingdom, or other jurisdictions, we may be unable to transfer personal data of Drivers, consumers, or employees in those regions, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we may be required to disclose personal data pursuant to demands from government agencies, which could result in proceedings or actions against us and adversely impact our reputation and brand.

# Conclusion

Such data protection laws, rules, and regulations are complex and their interpretation is rapidly evolving, making implementation and enforcement, and thus compliance requirements, ambiguous, uncertain, and potentially inconsistent.

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Legal and Compliance Risks

Includes, for example, those relating to the processing of data for purposes of advertising and profile creation, which are subject to evolving disclosure, choice, and consent requirements in the EU, US states, and other jurisdictions. Compliance with such laws may require changes to our data collection, use, transfer, disclosure, and other processing and certain other related business practices and may thereby increase compliance costs or otherwise adversely affect our operations.

Additionally, any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with privacy and data protection policies, notices, laws, rules, orders and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by individuals, consumer rights groups, governmental entities or agencies, or others. We could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, if found liable, significant damages. Further, these proceedings and any subsequent adverse outcomes may subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity. If any of these events were to occur, our business and financial results could be significantly disrupted and adversely affected.

# Litigation Risks

Adverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved could expose us to monetary damages or limit our ability to operate our business.

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future become, involved in private actions, collective actions, investigations, and various other legal proceedings by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers, Carriers, employees, commercial partners, competitors or, government agencies, among others. We are subject to litigation relating to various matters including Driver classification, Drivers’ tips and taxes, the Americans with Disabilities Act, antitrust, securities, intellectual property infringement, privacy, unfair competition, workplace culture, safety practices, personal injury, and employment and human resources practices.

The results of any such litigation, investigations, and legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable and expensive. Any claims against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time consuming, costly, and harmful to our reputation, and could require significant amounts of management time and corporate resources. If any of these legal proceedings were to be determined adversely to us, or we were to enter into a settlement arrangement, we could be exposed to monetary damages or be forced to change the way in which we operate our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.

# Arbitration Provisions

In addition, we regularly include arbitration provisions in our terms of service with end-users. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as arbitration can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in state or federal court. However, arbitration may become more costly for us, or the volume of arbitrations may increase and become burdensome. Further, the use of arbitration provisions may subject us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny.

To minimize these risks, we have in the past and may in the future voluntarily limit our use of arbitration provisions, or we may be required to do so, in any legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could increase our litigation costs and exposure in respect of such proceedings. For example, effective May 15, 2018, we ended mandatory arbitration of sexual misconduct claims by platform users and employees.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration on a state-by-state basis, as well as conflicting rules between state and federal law, some or all of our arbitration provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised to exempt certain categories of protection. If our arbitration agreements were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in part, or specific claims were required to be exempted from arbitration, we could experience an increase in our litigation costs and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects.

# Anti-Corruption Compliance

We have operations in countries known to experience high levels of corruption and were previously subject to, and may in the future be subject to, inquiries, investigations, and requests for information with respect to our compliance with a number of anti-corruption laws to which we are subject.

We have operations in, and have business relationships with, entities in countries known to experience high levels of corruption. We are subject to the FCPA and other similar laws outside the United States that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign officials, foreign political parties, or candidates for foreign political office for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. U.S. and non-U.S. regulators alike continue to focus on the enforcement of these laws, and we may be subject to additional compliance requirements to identify criminal activity and payments to sanctioned parties.

Our activities in certain countries with high levels of corruption enhance the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by Drivers, consumers, merchants, Shippers or Carriers, employees, consultants, or business partners in violation of various anti-corruption laws, including the FCPA, even though the actions of these parties are often outside our control. Our acquisition of Careem may further enhance this risk because users of Careem’s platform and Careem’s employees, consultants, and business partners may not be familiar with, and may not have been previously subject to, these anti-corruption laws.

In addition, our existing and future safeguards, including training and compliance programs to discourage these practices by such parties, may not prove effective, and such parties may engage in conduct for which we could be held responsible. Additional compliance requirements may compel us to revise or expand our compliance program, including the procedures we use to verify the identity of platform users and monitor international and domestic transactions.

Drivers may become subject to increased licensing requirements, and we may be required to obtain additional licenses or cap the number of Drivers using our platform.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Regulatory Environment

Many Drivers currently are not required to obtain a commercial taxi or livery license in their respective jurisdictions. However, numerous jurisdictions in which we operate have conducted investigations or taken action to enforce existing licensing rules, including markets within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region. Many others, including countries in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations that require Drivers to be licensed with local authorities or require us or our subsidiaries to be licensed as a transportation company.

Local regulations requiring the licensing of us or Drivers may adversely affect our ability to scale our business and operations. In addition, it is possible that various jurisdictions could impose caps on the number of licensed Drivers or vehicles with whom we may partner or impose limitations on the maximum number of hours a Driver may work, similar to recent regulations that were adopted in Spain and New York City, which have temporarily frozen new vehicle licenses for Drivers using platforms like ours. If we or Drivers become subject to such caps, limitations, or licensing requirements, our business and growth prospects would be adversely impacted.

# Liability and Legal Challenges

We may be subject to liability for the means we use to attract and onboard Drivers. We operate in an industry in which the competition for Drivers is intense. In this highly competitive environment, the means we use to onboard and attract Drivers may be challenged by competitors, government regulators, or individual plaintiffs. For example, putative class actions have been filed by individual plaintiffs against us for alleged violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, alleging, among other things, that plaintiffs received text messages from us regarding our Driver program without their consent or after indicating to us they no longer wished to receive such text messages.

These lawsuits are expensive and time-consuming to defend, and, if resolved adversely to us, could result in material financial damages and penalties, costly adjustments to our business practices, and negative publicity. In addition, we could incur substantial expense and possible loss of revenue if competitors file additional lawsuits or other claims challenging these practices.

# Insurance Coverage

Our business depends heavily on insurance coverage for Drivers and on other types of insurance for additional risks related to our business. If insurance carriers change the terms of such insurance in a manner not favorable to Drivers or to us, if we are required to purchase additional insurance for other aspects of our business, or if we fail to comply with regulations governing insurance coverage, our business could be harmed.

We use a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary. Insurance related to our Mobility products may include third-party automobile, automobile comprehensive and collision, physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. We require Drivers to carry automobile insurance in most countries, and in many cases, we also maintain insurance on behalf of Drivers.

We rely on a limited number of ridesharing insurance providers, particularly internationally, and should such providers discontinue or increase the cost of coverage, we cannot guarantee that we would be able to secure replacement coverage on reasonable terms or at all. In addition to insurance related to our products, we maintain other automobile insurance coverage for owned vehicles and employee activity, as well as insurance coverage for non-automotive corporate risks including general liability, workers’ compensation, property, cyber liability, and director and officers’ liability.

If our insurance carriers change the terms of our policies in a manner unfavorable to us or Drivers, our insurance costs could increase. The cost of insurance that we maintain on behalf of Drivers is higher in the United States and Canada than in other geographies. Further, if the insurance coverage we maintain is not adequate to cover losses that occur, we could be liable for significant additional costs.

In addition, we and our captive insurance subsidiary are party to certain reinsurance and indemnification arrangements that transfer a significant portion of the risk from the insurance provider to us or our captive insurance subsidiary, which could require us to pay out material amounts that may be in excess of our insurance reserves, including as a result of adverse legal proceedings, resulting in harm to our financial condition.

Our insurance reserves account for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for risks retained by us through our captive insurance subsidiary and other risk retention mechanisms. Such amounts are based on actuarial estimates, historical claim information, and industry data. While management believes that these reserve amounts are adequate, the ultimate liability could be in excess of our reserves.

We also have requirements to post collateral for current and future claim settlement obligations with certain of our insurance carriers, which may have a significant impact on our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents available for general business purposes.

# Claims and Incidents

We may be subject to claims of significant liability based on traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, even when those Drivers are not actively using our platform or when an individual impersonates a Driver. As we expand to include more offerings on our platform, our insurance needs will likely extend to those additional offerings, including Freight.

As a result, our automobile liability and general liability insurance policies and insurance maintained by Drivers may not cover all potential claims related to traffic accidents, injuries, or other incidents that are claimed to have been caused by Drivers who use our platform, and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that we could face. Even if these claims do not result in liability, we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against them.

If insurers become insolvent, they may not be able to pay otherwise valid claims in a timely manner or at all. If we are subject to claims of liability relating to the acts of Drivers or others using our platform, we may be subject to negative publicity and incur additional expenses, which could harm our business, financial condition, and operating results.

In addition, we are subject to local laws, rules, and regulations relating to insurance coverage which could result in...

# Quarterly Report

This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Legal and Regulatory Risks

Proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others may arise due to various factors, including compliance with insurance requirements related to ridesharing. Legislation has been passed in many U.S. jurisdictions that codifies these insurance requirements, and additional legislation has been proposed in other jurisdictions. Failure to comply with local laws or contractual obligations could result in significant penalties, negative publicity, increased insurance coverage, and disruption of our business.

# Pricing Regulations

Our revenue is dependent on the pricing models we use to calculate consumer fares and Driver earnings. These models, including dynamic pricing, have faced challenges and regulations in various jurisdictions. For instance, we have agreed to not exceed government-mandated fares in major Indian cities, and Honolulu has capped surge pricing. Increased regulation could raise our operating costs and adversely affect our business.

# Intellectual Property Protection

Our intellectual property is crucial to our competitive advantage and includes various forms of content, software, trademarks, and patents. We rely on legal protections and contractual agreements to safeguard our intellectual property. However, these measures may not be sufficient, and we may face challenges in protecting our rights, including potential infringement claims from third parties. Any failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively impact our business and financial condition.

# Litigation Risks

We may face litigation related to intellectual property claims, especially as we introduce new products or enter new markets. Such litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there is no guarantee of a favorable outcome. Additionally, if we are found to infringe on others' intellectual property rights, it could result in significant expenses and harm our reputation.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC. It contains many tables.

# Risks Related to Intellectual Property

Any intellectual property claim against us, regardless of merit, could be time-consuming and expensive to settle or litigate, could divert our management’s attention and other resources, and could hurt goodwill associated with our brand. These claims may also subject us to significant liability for damages and may result in us having to stop using technology, content, branding, or business methods found to be in violation of another party’s rights. Further, certain adverse outcomes of such proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in existing or future businesses.

We may be required or may opt to seek a license for the right to use intellectual property held by others, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if a license is available, we may be required to pay significant royalties or license fees, which may increase our operating expenses. We may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, content, branding, or business methods, which could require significant effort and expense and make us less competitive. If we cannot license or develop alternative technology, content, branding, or business methods for any allegedly infringing aspect of our business, we may be unable to compete effectively or we may be prevented from operating our business in certain jurisdictions. Any of these results could harm our operating results.

# Changes in Accounting Principles

Our reported financial results may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles. The accounting for our business is complicated, particularly in the area of revenue recognition, and is subject to change based on the evolution of our business model, interpretations of relevant accounting principles, enforcement of existing or new regulations, and changes in SEC or other agency policies, rules, regulations, and interpretations of accounting regulations. Changes to our business model and accounting methods could result in changes to our financial statements, including changes in revenue and expenses in any period, or in certain categories of revenue and expenses moving to different periods, may result in materially different financial results, and may require that we change how we process, analyze, and report financial information and our financial reporting controls.

# Investment Company Act Risks

If we are deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act, applicable restrictions could have an adverse effect on our business. The Investment Company Act contains substantive legal requirements that regulate the manner in which “investment companies” are permitted to conduct their business activities. We believe that we have conducted our business in a manner that does not result in being characterized as an “investment company” under the Investment Company Act because we are primarily engaged in a non-investment company business. Although a significant portion of our assets constitute investments in non-controlled entities (including in China), referred to elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as minority-owned entities, we believe that we are not an investment company as defined by the Investment Company Act.

While we intend to conduct our operations such that we will not be deemed an investment company, such a determination would require us to initiate burdensome compliance requirements and comply with restrictions imposed by the Investment Company Act that would limit our activities, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with subsidiaries and other entities, which would have an adverse effect on our financial condition. To avoid such a determination, we may be required to conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which could have an adverse effect on our business. For example, we may be required to sell certain of our assets and pay significant taxes upon the sale or transfer of such assets.

# Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock

The market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile or may decline steeply or suddenly regardless of our operating performance, and we may not be able to meet investor or analyst expectations. You may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid and may lose all or part of your investment.

The market price of our common stock may fluctuate or decline significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:

- actual or anticipated fluctuations in MAPCs, Trips, Adjusted EBITDA, Free Cash Flow, Gross Bookings, revenue, or other operating and financial results;
- announcements by us or estimates by third parties of actual or anticipated changes in the number of Drivers and consumers on our platform;
- variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of our management, securities analysts, investors, the financial community;
- changes in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect financial results;
- actions of securities analysts who initiate or maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by any securities.

# Quarterly Report

# Uber Technologies, Inc.

# Factors Affecting Stock Price

The following factors may affect our stock price:

- Analyst estimates and investor expectations.
- Announcements of significant products, features, or partnerships.
- Negative media coverage.
- Changes in operating performance and stock market valuations.
- Price and volume fluctuations in the stock market.
- Lawsuits against the company.
- Legislative or regulatory developments.
- Changes in accounting standards.
- Major changes in management or the board of directors.
- Safety incidents on our platform.
- Public statements regarding the legality of our offerings.
- Trading activity in our share repurchase program.
- Other events such as war, terrorism, or natural disasters.

# Impact of Market Fluctuations

Price and volume fluctuations in the stock markets have affected many technology companies’ stock prices, often in ways unrelated to their operating performance. Past volatility has led to securities class action litigation against us, which could result in substantial costs and divert management's attention from business operations.

# Corporate Governance Provisions

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a change of control, potentially depressing our stock price:

- Board of directors can fill vacancies, limiting stockholder influence.
- Advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals.
- Limitations on convening special stockholder meetings.
- Prohibition on cumulative voting in director elections.
- Board can issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.

These provisions may limit stockholders' opportunities to receive a premium for their shares in the event of a takeover.

# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.

This document is a quarterly report filed by Uber Technologies, Inc. with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This form provides detailed financial information about the company's performance for a specific quarter. It includes unaudited financial statements, management discussion and analysis, and other relevant disclosures required by the SEC.

# Risk Factors

Sales, directly or indirectly, of shares of our common stock by existing stockholders could cause our stock price to decline. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock, or the public perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.

We may issue our shares of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for our common stock from time to time in connection with a financing, acquisition, investments or otherwise. Such issuances could result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders and cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.

# Dividends

We do not intend to pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business.

# Exclusive Forum Provision

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and, to the extent enforceable, the federal district courts of the United States of America are the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders. This could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

- Any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;
- Any action asserting a breach of fiduciary duty;
- Any action asserting a claim against us or our directors, officers, or employees arising under the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;
- Any action regarding our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws;
- Any action as to which the Delaware General Corporation Law confers jurisdiction to the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware;
- Any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal-affairs doctrine.

This provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the U.S. federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

# Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

If we are unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, and the market price of our common stock may be harmed. As a result of being a public company, we are obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal controls over financial reporting.
# Quarterly Report - Uber Technologies, Inc.

# Quarterly Report Filed by Uber Technologies, Inc.

# Section 404 Compliance

We are required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“Section 404”), to furnish an annual report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting annually. We currently are required to disclose changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting on a quarterly basis.

The process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 is costly and challenging, and we may not be able to complete evaluation, testing, and any required remediation in a timely fashion. As our business continues to grow in size and complexity, we are improving our processes and infrastructure to help ensure we can prepare financial reporting and disclosures within the timeline required for a public company. During the evaluation and testing process of our internal controls, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective.

We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, which may cause challenges in consistent performance and timely designing new controls. Any failure to maintain internal control over financial reporting could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or operating results. If we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm determines we have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, the market price of our common stock could decline, and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. Failure to remedy any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, or to implement or maintain these and other effective control systems, could also restrict our future access to the capital markets.
